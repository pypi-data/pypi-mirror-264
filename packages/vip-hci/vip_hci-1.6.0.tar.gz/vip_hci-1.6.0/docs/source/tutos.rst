Running the tutorials
---------------------

Tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks and showcasing ``VIP``'s usage can be visualised within this documentation.
**In order to execute the notebook tutorials, you will have to download or clone the VIP-extras repository, and open each tutorial locally with jupyter notebook.**
The ``VIP-extras`` repository is available `here <https://github.com/vortex-exoplanet/VIP_extras>`_.
Alternatively, you can execute these tutorials on 
`Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/vortex-exoplanet/VIP_extras/master>`_. 

If you are new to the Jupyter notebook application check out the `beginner's guide
<https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html>`_.

For notebooks 1 and 3, an object-oriented version is available, leveraging new Dataset and Post-processing algorithm Classes.
Note that these tutorials (1B and 3B) will only run for Python versions 3.10 or later.s
