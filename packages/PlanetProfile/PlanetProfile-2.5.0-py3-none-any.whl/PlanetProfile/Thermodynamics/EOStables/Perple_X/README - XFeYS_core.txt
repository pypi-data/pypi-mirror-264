This is a description file for all XFe_YS_core Perple_X runs.

They was run with Perple_X version 6.8.6.

The compositions represent the bulk inner core compositions, ranging from 80 wt. % Fe with 20 wt. % S to 100 wt. % Fe and 0 wt. % S. See the complementary silicate portion runs for Ganymede, based on CM chondrite compositions, minus the (From Lodders and Fegley, 1998).

The thermodynamic database used was SE15ver.dat.

Solution models included, and phases excluded, were based on the Saxena and Eriksson (2015) Calphad model.

Note that fluids and melt are allowed and that WERAMI tables show bulk (aggregate) properties of fluids and solids. In the case of the core, exclusion of liquid from the seismic properties table cannot be justified.
