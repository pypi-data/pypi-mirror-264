      Is important to use physical addresses (non-secure) in settings of OTFAD to proper run the decryption on device.

      The fuse word 0x47 on address 0xC70 uses error-correcting codes.
      The fuse word can only be written one time, so you must set all of the desired bits within the word at the same time.
      Refer to the SRM to get familiar with the functionality of all bitfields.
      The ENCRYPT_XIP_EN fuse is part of the BOOT_CFG1 fuse. If this bit is set, all BOOT_CFG fuses must be configured accordingly.
      The encrypted XiP can be also enabled by the BOOT_CFG pin

      It is recommended to set the USER_KEY5_RLOCK and OTFAD1/2_KEY_SEL_LOCK fuses for production to protect sensitive data stored in the USER_KEY5 fuse (if used) and to prevent a modification of the OTFAD key selection by malicious software.
