DESCRIBE_IMAGE = "Given an image, provide a detailed, comprehensive description that meticulously outlines all visible elements, their properties, spatial relationships, colors, textures, and any discernable patterns or symbols. Break down the scene into foreground, midground, and background elements where applicable. Describe the lighting, mood, and atmosphere. Specify the dimensions and proportions of distinct objects, as well as their relative positions to one another. Note any text, numbers, or identifiable symbols, including their font style, size, and color. If living entities (people, animals) are present, describe their appearances, expressions, postures, and clothing (if any) in detail. Where relevant, provide context or a narrative that could infer the time period, location, or cultural elements depicted. Your description should be sufficiently detailed to enable another system to recreate a similar image based on your text alone."

UPDATE_IMAGE_DESCRIPTION = "Given the initial image description provided below, enhance the description by adding more vivid details, incorporating a variety of sensory inputs, and enhancing the overall styling to create a more immersive and engaging depiction of the scene. Aim to transform the original, simpler description into a richly detailed narrative that not only paints a clearer picture for the reader but also evokes emotions and a deeper connection to the scene described."

UPDATE_IMAGE_DESCRIPTION_SYSTEM = "Your task is to refine and elevate the provided AI prompt. Transform the initial prompt into a version that captures the essence of the original request but expands it with added clarity, detail, and guidance. Your goal is to make the revised prompt more engaging, comprehensive, and capable of eliciting responses that are not only accurate and relevant but also richly detailed and captivating. Consider the audience and the intended use case to ensure that the revised prompt aligns with and enhances the user's objectives."
