## Install

You can install the `cuapi_wrapper` package through PyPI:

``` sh
pip install cuapi_wrapper
```

## How to use

Start by importing all the modules youâ€™ll need for your project. The
`cuapi_wrapper` package is broken down into seperate modules for working
with companies, tasks, opportunities, users, etc.

For example, if we wanted to look at **companies** in copper, we should
start by importing the **copper_crm.companies** module. We can then
search these companies for those who are in California:

``` python
import cuapi_wrapper.companies as coppper

copper.set_headers(os.environ['MY_COPPER_KEY'],'myemail@email.com)
copper.search(search_params{'state':'CA'})
```
