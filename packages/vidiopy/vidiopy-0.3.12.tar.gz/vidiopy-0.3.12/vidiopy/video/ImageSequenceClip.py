class ImageSequenceClip(VideoClip):
    """
    A class used to represent a sequence of images as a video clip.

    This class extends the VideoClip class and provides additional functionality for handling sequences of images. It allows for the creation of a video clip from a sequence of images, with the ability to specify the frames per second (fps) and duration of the clip. The sequence of images can be provided as a tuple of PIL Images, paths to images, numpy arrays, or a path to a directory. The class also provides methods for importing the image sequence, generating a numpy array or PIL Image representation of a specific frame in the clip, and applying a function to each frame of the clip.

    Attributes:
        clip (tuple[Image.Image, ...]): The sequence of images as a tuple of PIL Images.
        fps (int | float | None): The frames per second of the clip.
        _dur (int | float | None): The duration of the clip in seconds.
        audio (optional): The audio of the clip.

    Methods:
        __init__(sequence, fps=None, duration=None, audio=None): Initializes an instance of the ImageSequenceClip class.
        __eq__(other): Checks if this instance is equal to another instance.
        _import_image_sequence(sequence): Imports an image sequence from a tuple of PIL Images, paths to images, numpy arrays, or a path to a directory.
        make_frame_array(t): Generates a numpy array representation of a specific frame in the clip.
        make_frame_pil(t): Generates a PIL Image representation of a specific frame in the clip.
        fl_frame_transform(func, *args, **kwargs): Applies a function to each frame of the clip.
        fl_clip_transform(func, *args, **kwargs): Applies a function to each frame of the clip along with its timestamp.

        Initializes an instance of the ImageSequenceClip class.

        This method imports an image sequence from the specified sequence, sets the fps and duration of the image sequence clip, and sets the audio of the image sequence clip if specified.

        Args:
            sequence (str | Path | tuple[Image.Image, ...] | tuple[np.ndarray, ...] | tuple[str | Path, ...]): The sequence to import. It can be a tuple of PIL Images, paths to images, numpy arrays, or a path to a directory.
            fps (int | float | None, optional): The frames per second of the image sequence clip. If not specified, it is calculated from the duration and the number of images in the sequence.
            duration (int | float | None, optional): The duration of the image sequence clip in seconds. If not specified, it is calculated from the fps and the number of images in the sequence.
            audio (optional): The audio of the image sequence clip. If not specified, the image sequence clip will have no audio.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If neither fps nor duration is specified.
            ValueError: If not all images in the sequence have the same size.

        Example:

        Note:
            This method uses the _import_image_sequence method to import the image sequence and the set_audio method to set the audio of the image sequence clip.
