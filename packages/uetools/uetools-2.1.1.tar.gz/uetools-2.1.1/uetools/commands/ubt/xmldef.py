class BuildConfigurationT:
    bIgnoreOutdatedImportLibraries: bool  = None  # Whether to ignore import library files that are out of date when building targets. Set this to true to improve iteration time. By default, we do not bother re-linking targets if only a dependent <code>.lib</code> file has changed, as chances are that the import library was not actually different unless a dependent header file of this target was also changed, in which case the target would automatically be rebuilt.
    bPrintDebugInfo               : bool  = None  # Whether debug info should be written to the console.
    bAllowHybridExecutor          : bool  = None  # Whether the hybrid executor will be used (a remote executor and local executor).

    bUseUBTMakefiles              : bool  = None  # Enables support for very fast iterative builds by caching target data. Turning this on causes Unreal Build Tool (UBT) to emit 'UBT Makefiles' for targets when they are built the first time. Subsequent builds will load these Makefiles and begin outdatedness checking and build invocation very quickly. The caveat is that if source files are added or removed to the project, UBT will need to gather information about those in order for your build to complete successfully. Currently, you must run the project file generator after adding/removing source files to tell UBT to re-gather this information.
    MaxParallelActions            : str   = None  # Number of actions that can be executed in parallel. If 0 then code will pick a default based on the number of cores and memory available. Applies to the ParallelExecutor, HybridExecutor, and LocalExecutor.

    bCompactOutput                : bool  = None  # Instruct the executor to write compact output (for example, only errors), if supported by the executor. This field is used to hold the value when specified from the command line or XML.
    bDebugBuildsActuallyUseDebugCRT: bool  = None  # Enables the debug C++ runtime (CRT) for debug builds. By default we always use the release runtime, since the debug version isn't particularly useful when debugging Unreal Engine projects, and linking against the debug CRT libraries forces our third party library dependencies to also be compiled using the debug CRT (and often perform more slowly). Often it can be inconvenient to require a separate copy of the debug versions of third party static libraries simply so that you can debug your program's code.
    bLegalToDistributeBinary      : bool  = None  # Whether the output from this target can be publicly distributed, even if it has dependencies on modules that are in folders with special restrictions (for example, CarefullyRedist, NotForLicensees, NoRedist).

    bUseAdaptiveUnityBuild        : bool  = None  # Use a heuristic to determine which files are currently being iterated on and exclude them from unity blobs, resulting in faster incremental compile times. The current implementation uses the read-only flag to distinguish the working set, assuming that files will be made writable by the source control system if they are being modified. This is true for Perforce, but not for Git.
    bAdaptiveUnityDisablesOptimizations: bool  = None  # Disable optimization for files that are in the adaptive non-unity working set.
    bAdaptiveUnityDisablesPCH     : bool  = None  # Disables force-included Precompiled Headers (PCHs) for files that are in the adaptive non-unity working set.

    bAdaptiveUnityCreatesDedicatedPCH: bool  = None  # Creates a dedicated PCH for each source file in the working set, allowing faster iteration on cpp-only changes.
    bAdaptiveUnityEnablesEditAndContinue: bool  = None  # Creates a dedicated PCH for each source file in the working set, allowing faster iteration on cpp-only changes.
    bAdaptiveUnityCompilesHeaderFiles: bool  = None  # Creates a dedicated source file for each header file in the working set to detect missing includes in headers.
    MinGameModuleSourceFilesForUnityBuild: str   = None  # The number of source files in a game module before unity build will be activated for that module.  This allows small game modules to have faster iterative compile times for single files, at the expense of slower full rebuild times.  This setting can be overridden by the <code>bFasterWithoutUnity</code> option in a module's <code>.Build.cs</code> file.

    UnsafeTypeCastWarningLevel    : str   = None  # Indicates what warning/error level to treat unsafe type casts as on platforms that support it (for example, <code>double-&gt;float</code> or <code>int64-&gt;int32</code>).
    bUndefinedIdentifierErrors    : bool  = None  # Forces the use of undefined identifiers in conditional expressions to be treated as errors.
    bRetainFramePointers          : bool  = None  # Forces frame pointers to be retained. This is usually required when you want reliable callstacks (for example, <code>mallocframeprofiler</code>).

    bOmitPCDebugInfoInDevelopment : bool  = None  # Whether to disable debug info on PC/Mac in development builds (for faster developer iteration, as link times are extremely fast with debug info disabled).

    StaticAnalyzerOutputType      : str   = None  # The output type to use for the static analyzer. This is only supported for Clang.
    StaticAnalyzerMode            : str   = None  # The mode to use for the static analyzer. This is only supported for Clang. Shallow mode completes quicker but is generally not recommended.
    MinFilesUsingPrecompiledHeader: str   = None  # The minimum number of files that must use a pre-compiled header before it will be created and used.
    bForcePrecompiledHeaderForGameModules: bool  = None  # When enabled, a precompiled header is always generated for game modules, even if there are only a few source files in the module.  This greatly improves compile times for iterative changes on a few files in the project, at the expense of slower full rebuild times for small game projects.  This can be overridden by setting <code>MinFilesUsingPrecompiledHeaderOverride</code> in a module's <code>Build.cs</code> file.
    bUseIncrementalLinking        : bool  = None  # Whether to use incremental linking or not. Incremental linking can yield faster iteration times when making small changes. Currently disabled by default because it tends to behave a bit buggy on some computers (PDB-related compile errors).

    bUseShippingPhysXLibraries    : bool  = None  # True if Development and Release builds should use the release configuration of PhysX/APEX.
    bUseCheckedPhysXLibraries     : bool  = None  # True if Development and Release builds should use the checked configuration of PhysX/APEX. if <code>bUseShippingPhysXLibraries</code> is true this is ignored.
