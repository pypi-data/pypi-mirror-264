# PCombinator

A handy tool for building, manipulating and evaluating **prompts** in both development and production. 

- ðŸŽ¯ Generate variations of prompts for large language and vision models, and evaluate the effectiveness of each particle in the variation. With it you can systematically optimize your prompts. 
- ðŸŽ¯ Combine prompts from hierarchical ingredients at runtime, for example when different invocations of a model require slightly different prompts, retrieval augmentation, and more.

Some examples of questions you can easily test using PCombinator:

- âœ… Is giving a an example (few shot) to the prompt contributes to effectiveness?
- âœ… Is a specific example or combination of examples better than the others?
- âœ… Is this additional instruction helpful?
- âœ… Is putting the examples before the rules or instructions better, or is it vice versa? (also see [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08939.pdf))
- âœ… Which delimiter is the best for separating examples? (also see [])
- âœ… Does Chain of Though (CoT) help or just cost more?
- âœ… Does the order of the examples matter?
- âœ… Do I need this many examples?
- âœ… Should I use an instructive language or a more conversational one?
- âœ… Is a certain role for the model biases it better than another role?
- âœ… Which terms in a text2image prompt contribute more to the effectiveness of the prompt?
- âœ… Combine prompt injection techniques to evaluate how malicous users can exploit the model and overcome protections. (also see [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03729))

### Main Concepts

There are two parts to the library, each can be used independently:

1. The **Combinators** (arranged in a tree): which generate the prompts.
2. The **Evaluator**: which evaluates the effectiveness of the prompts. This is work in progress. 

#### Paths and Rendering

There are two main **actions** in the library:

1. **Generating** **Paths** - which are walks down the combinator tree, i.e. specific combinations of the ingredients in the tree. This is done using the `generate_paths` method of the combinator.
2. **Rendering** a prompt: The process of generating a prompt from a path in the combinator tree. This is done using the `render_path` method of the combinator.

Some metrics that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the prompts:
- ðŸ“ˆ The score given by a human or a model judge to the output. 
- ðŸ“ˆ Use score on existing labeled datasets and evaluators. 
- ðŸ“‰ The perplexity of the model on the prompt. 

## How to use it?

A simple example is below. A more full example is in the `examples` folder and at the end of this document. 

### Installation

To install the full package, including the `templating` extension, use:

```bash
Pip: 

```bash
pip install PCombinator[templating]
```

Poetry:
  
```bash
poetry add PCombinator --extras templating
```


### Simple example - LLMs

```python
import random
from pcombinator.combinators import JoinSomeOf, NamedString, Jinja2Template, PickOne


# Create the combinators
template_combinator = Jinja2Template(
    "{role}\n{instruction}.",
    children={
        "role": PickOne(
            id="role_combinator",
            children=[
                NamedString("variation_1", "You are a a useful assistant"),
                "As a helpful assistant",  # unnamed string
                None # If we want to try the prompt without the role
            ]
        ),
        "instruction": JoinSomeOf(
            id="instruction_combinator",
            n_min=1,
            n_max=2,
            children=[
                "Do A",
                "Perform A",
                "Execute A",
            ],
            separator=" or ",
        ),
    },
)

# # OPTIONAL: Save the combinator tree for future use
# json_str = template_combinator.to_json()
# with open("path/to/combinator.json", "w") as f:
#     f.write(json_str)
# # Loading the combinator tree looks as following:
# with open("path/to/combinator.json", "r") as f:
#     json_str = f.read()
#     loaded_combinator = Combinator.from_json(json_str)

# Create all the possible paths in the tree
paths = template_combinator.generate_paths()

res = []
for idx, path in enumerate(paths):
  # Render the path (creating the prompt)
  rendered_prompt = root_combinator.render_path(path)
  res.append((rendered_prompt, path))
  print(rendered_prompt)
  print("-" * 80)
  print(path)
  print("=" * 80)


# Save the prompts and id_tree for later evaluation
with open("path/to/prompt.json", "w") as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(res))

```

### Simple Example - Vision Models

```python

```


# Detailed explanation

## Currently available combinators

1. `JoinSomeOf`: Creates combinations of between n_min to n_max (inclusive) children in each combination. Renders with a separator between each child.
2. `NamedString`: A string with an identifier. Useful for tracking the contribution of each part of the prompt.
3. `PickOne`: Picks one of the children.
4. `Jinja2Template`: A Jinja2 template combinator. Fills the template with the children.

## How does it work?

PCombinator creates combinations of prompts from a tree of other combinators, and eventually string or None values at the leaves. It also stores the identifiers used to create the specific combination, for later evaluation of the effectiveness of each node in the tree. The evaluation functionality itself is not yet implemented.

# Path

The Path represents the specific identifiers used at each node in the tree to create a specific prompt. Essentially the "bill of materials".

With a Path object you can:
1. Render the prompt (using the `render_path` method of a combinator)
2. Associate the ingredients of the prompt with an evaluation metric to measure the individual contribution of each ingredient to the effectiveness of the prompt.
3. Replace parts of the path dynamically in runtime, for example injecting (retrieval) augmentation info into the prompt, changing rules based on user's permissions and context, and more.

To see how a Path is contstructed, please see [Path](docs/path.md).

# Persistance

## Persisting and loading the Combinator tree

The library supports JSON serialization and deserialization of the combinator tree. This allows you to save the tree to a file, and load it later to generate prompts. 

We recommend using JSON over pickle due to security concerns with pickle.

```python
        template_source = "{{role}}\n{{task}}\n{{question}}\n"
        template_combinator = Jinja2Template(
            template_source=template_source,
            children={
                "role": NamedString("role_id", "value_1"),
                "task": "task_value",
                "question": JoinSomeOf(
                    n_max=1,
                    n_min=1,
                    children=["option_1"],
                    separator="\n",
                    id="question_randomizer_1",
                ),
            },
            id="template_1",
        )

        # Persist to a JSON string
        json_str = template_combinator.to_json()

        # Store the JSON string to file
        with open("path/to/combinator.json", "w") as f:
            f.write(json_str)

        # Load the JSON string from file
        loaded_json_str = ""
        with open("path/to/combinator.json", "r") as f:
            loaded_json_str = f.read()

        # Load from the JSON string
        loaded_combinator = Combinator.from_json(loaded_json_str)

```

## Persisting and loading the rendered prompts

The rendered prompts are strings, and each associated Path is a simple dictionary, with no dependence on custom objects. 

This means we can simply serialize, store, load and deserialize the prompts using and serialization and storage of our choice without explicit support in the library. 

```python
# Render all combinations of the prompts and store them to a string
all_paths = template_combinator.generate_paths()
storage = []
for path in all_paths:
    prompt = root_combinator.render_path(path)
    storage.append((prompt, path))

serialized = json.dumps(storage)
```

A different method is to use the (`versioned-collection`)[https://github.com/RomansWorks/versioned-collection] library:

```bash
pip install versioned-collection    
```

```python
from versioned_collection import Collection, CollectionStore

collection = Collection(items=[Item(key="my.item", value="my item value")])
# Or add one by one
collection.add(Item(key="my.item", value="my item value"))

collection_store = CollectionStore(...)
collection_store.store(collection)
```

And then load in the target app using:

```python
from versioned_collection import CollectionStore

collection = CollectionStore.load(url="path/to/collection")
```

## Persisting and loading the combinator tree and rendered prompts together
