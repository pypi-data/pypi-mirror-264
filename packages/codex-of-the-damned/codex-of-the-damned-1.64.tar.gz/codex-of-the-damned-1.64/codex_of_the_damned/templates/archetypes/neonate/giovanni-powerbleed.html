<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>powerbleed</em> deck using the {{ dom }}{{ nec }} disciplines.
    The idea is to use {{ govern_the_unaligned }} at superior to bring 4 midcap vampires
    out quickly and cheaply, then bleed as hard as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Dominate {{ dom }} provides heavy bleed with {{ govern_the_unaligned }},
    {{ conditioning }} and {{ foreshadowing_destruction }}. The core idea of this deck
    is to rely on block denial instead of stealth to make sure the huge bleeds get
    through. {{ seduction }} is complemented by {{ call_of_the_hungry_dead }}
    to that effect. {{ bonding }} and {{ spectral_divination }} provide a bit of stealth
    to reduce the number of potential blockers. A couple of Master cards support
    the plan: {{ pentex_subversion }} of course, but also {{ misdirection }} and
    {{ anarch_troublemaker }}.
</p>
<p>
    On the defense side, the deck simply uses {{ deflection }} to avoid bleeds and add
    them to the offensive stack the prey has to burden with. For combat,
    simple avoidance with {{ spiritual_intervention }}.
</p>
<p>
    The blood cost is pretty heavy in this deck. Half of the Master module is dedicated
    to blood regeneration with cards like {{ the_coven }},
    {{ acquired_ventrue_assets }} and {{ jake_washington }}. On top of that, a few
    hunts might be welcome if this does not give too much of a block opportunity to the
    predator.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is very heavy on the prey and pretty straightforward to use.
    Timing is key here: going at a prey too soon will
    prevent her to spend pool on influence but also to hurt the next prey's pool.
    The ideal trajectory is to leave a bit of breathing room to the prey, bleeding
    sparingly and using a couple of {{ govern_the_unaligned }} at superior, so that
    she can go forward a bit. Once the time is right and pool has been spent for
    influence, a few bleeds for 3 or 4 to exhaust the bounces and put pressure then,
    once the stars are aligned, full forward with bleeds for 6.
</p>
<p>
    Given the slim combat module, the deck is fragile against combat decks.
    The plan is to avoid them, which can be difficult especially if they have rushes.
    If they are cross table it might be best to go slow to let their neighbour deal
    with them first. If they are prey, the best course of action might be to try to find
    some kind of deal to avoid getting hurt.

</p>
<h2>Tweaks and variants</h2>
<p>
    This heavily inspired by many tournament winning decks, check the
    {{ main_archetype }} page for more information and variants.
</p>
<p>
    A couple of {{ trochomancy }} can help control recursion-based decks like those
    using {{ ashur_tablets }} or {{ emerald_legionnaire }}. The proportions can be
    slightly adjusted to your preferences and to match the {{ metagame }} you expect.
</p>
<h2>What to buy</h2>
<p>
    All of the Giovanni {{ giovanni }} and {{ nec }} cards you need
    can be found on {{ drive_thru_cards }} as Print-on-Demand. For the rest, you will just
    need a {{ v5_ventrue }}, a {{ v5_malkavian }}, a {{ anniversary }} and a
    {{ parliament_of_shadows }}.
</p>
<p>
    If you have access to more cards and legacy cards,
    switching {{ marciana }} for {{ le_dinh_tho }} is an
    improvement. Moreover, adding copies of {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }}, {{ the_coven }}
    and {{ jake_washington }} can be good.
