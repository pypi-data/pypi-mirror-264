<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>vote</em> deck relying on <em>Princes</em> and <em>Barons</em> with {{ obf }} and {{ pre }}.
</p>
<p>
    There are multiple ways to approach this build given the variety of good <em>Princes</em> in the {{ v5_precons }}.
    This example focuses on using {{ arishat }} as a key vampire: her ability helps secure a vote lock, plus
    she has superior {{ obf }} and {{ pre }} and, last but not least, she can summon {{ unleash_hells_fury }}
    for defence.
</p>
<p>
    The plan is to get <em>Princes</em> in play fast with {{ information_highway }} for the vote lock,
    then use {{ parity_shift }} to bloat and {{ kine_resources_contested }} for additional damage.
    {{ obf }} provides a welcome support with stealth modifiers to ensure the votes do not get blocked easily.
</p>
<p>
    {{ pre }} provides useful vote-oriented support like {{ perfect_paragon }} and {{ voter_captivation }},
    while {{ obf }} gives access to stealth, especially the excellent {{ forgotten_labyrinth }}. On the combat side,
    the deck relies simply on {{ majesty }} to avoid getting hit too strong. A couple of {{ second_tradition_domain }}
    are included for versatility: a careful and well-timed block can change the flow of a game.
</p>
<p>
    Another key feature of the deck is its density: packing only 60 cards with two sets of {{ ashur_tablets }},
    it is able to very quickly adapt to the table dynamics by getting the exact 13 cards we need most back in the pile.
</p>
<h2>Tweaks and variants</h2>
<p>
    This deck is obviously inspired by Bram Van Stappen's {{ infernal_princes_of_anarchy }}.
</p>
<p>
    The most important point probably, if you have access to legacy cards, is to include some {{ reckless_agitation }}
    in the mix. They cost blood, but that can be recouped with {{ voter_captivation }}, and it does more damage
    than {{ kine_resources_contested }}. On the other hand, it is unusable in a duel (it requires at least two other
    methuselahs), so it can not completely replace {{ kine_resources_contested }}, but it packs a heavier punch.
    Other cards that deserve the mention are {{ protected_resources }} and {{ the_parthenon }}.
</p>
<p>
    Another interesting option if you acquire {{ heirs_to_the_blood_2 }} is to use {{ scout_youngwood }} as a star,
    together with {{ shattering_crescendo }} and {{ lily_prelude }}. These cards are also available as 
    {{ print_on_demand }}.
</p>
<h2>What to buy</h2>
<p>
    This is an expensive build if you're starting from nothing. The crypt itself has vampires coming from a lot of
    different bundles: most of the {{ v5_precons }} (Malkavian, Ventrue, Ministry, Banu Haqim, Brujah), plus
    both {{ keepers_of_traditions }}. On the other hand, if you started a small collection already and have one of each
    of most products in print, you should already have most of the cards.
    If you didn't get all the bundles already, you might want to buy or trade the vampires directly instead.
    If you're considering buying some and trading, focus on the {{ v5_malkavian }}, {{ v5_venture }} and
    {{ v5_ministry }}, they'll give you most of the library cards you need.
    {{ jacques_rouge }}Â is a Promo card, it can be replaced by {{ vivian_vi }}.
</p>
<p>
    Other than the crypt, key parts are two {{ heirs_to_the_blood_1 }} (that will give you {{ arishat }} and 
    {{ unleash_hells_fury }})
    and two {{ anthology }} for the {{ ashur_tablets }}. {{ forgotten_labyrinth }} has been reprinted in
    {{ new_blood_malkavian }} but otherwise it's easy to trade since it was a common in legacy sets. Getting four
    {{ information_highway }} is another tricky step: you might want to get {{ parliament_of_shadows }} and
    {{ anniversary }} to complement your {{ v5_ventrue }} bundle here: both provides a couple of useful cards on top.
