<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>powerbleed</em> deck that relies on big capacity natural bleeders
    like the Inner Circle and {{ lucian_the_perfect }}, combined with a lot of
    block denial and, specifically, a good number of {{ blind_spot }}.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is very simple: get two vampires out, then bleed for 6 to 10
    with each of them, disregarding the possibility of {{ archon_investigation }}.
    To get the bleed through, there is a bit of stealth but the main strategy
    is to combine multiple block denials like {{ blind_spot }}, {{ seduction }}
    and {{ elder_impersonation }} to prevent all the minions of the prey from blocking.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is brutal and can obliterate a table in just 10 turns if it's lucky.
    {{ blind_spot }} is particularily vicious because it also prevents reactions, hence
    {{ bounces }}. That makes it harder for the prey to defend against the high bleeds.
    Of course, for the card to work at all, one needs the highest capacity on the table.
    Because it relies on block denials, the deck can go through highly defensive
    toolboxes and walls as if they weren't even there.
</p>
<p>
    The Master module provides crypt acceleration with {{ zillahs_valley }},
    {{ information_highway }} and {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck relies on {{ obedience }} and {{ majesty }} to avoid combat and has low
    defense against bleeds from the predator: only a couple of {{ telepathic_counter }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ lucian_the_perfect }} is the most desirable vampire here: he bleeds harder, and
    his ability makes him a decent blocker, especially combined with Majesty.
    The deck has no intercept, but his ability to block swarms that do not use stealth
    is actually pretty high between {{ majesty }}, {{ obedience }} and
    {{ eluding_the_arms_of_morpheus }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck fields only a few cards for bloat, but they bloat hard: the {{ villein }}
    will be played for 5, and the one {{ golconda_inner_peace }} can be used to recoup
    11 pool in a single stroke if needed.
</p>
<p>
    {{ flurry_of_action }} is versatile here: it can be used to unlock, especially
    if {{ mistress_fanchon }} is out, so she can use her special ability after the bleed,
    but also just to stay unlocked for defense. Interestingly, it can also be used
    at inferior {{ cel }} to cycle cards and go fetch the right combination for the next
    bleed.
</p>
<p>
    {{ enkil_cog }} is, of course, desirable. Especially because one can use it to bleed
    during the prey's turn, which will completely negate the possibility of an
    {{ archon_investigation }}: since it's an out-of-turn Master, it cannot be played
    by the prey during their own turn.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    A few adaptations can be made without messing too much with the proportions here.
    Most notably, a bit more bleed defense with {{ deflection }} for example.
    In that case, one might want to cut {{ narrow_minds }}.
    {{ scourge_of_the_enochians }} might be a valuable inclusion if swarms are expected.
    See {{ desso_alastors_deck }} for an example.
