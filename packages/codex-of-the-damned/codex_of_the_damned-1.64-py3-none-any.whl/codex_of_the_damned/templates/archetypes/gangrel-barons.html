<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>wall</em> deck using Gangrel {{ gangrel }} barons.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to build a strong defense thanks to the Anarch and Baron cards for unlock and intercept,
    {{ organized_resistance }} and {{ deep_ecology }}, coupled with {{ bait_and_switch }} for bounces.
    Using {{ thing }}, the deck can steadily influence more and more vampires, often ending up with 4 to 6 vampires
    in play. Influencing a Baron quickly is very important, but it can be the second vampire if a low capacity
    can be put in play first to speed up the Baron with a {{ thing }}, depending on your opening hand.
</p>
<p>
    The number of vampires allows for a decent forward pressure of naked bleed actions, and the Barons open
    the possibility of voting to speed things up or finish the endgame duel turns with a {{ revolutionary_council }}.
    This completes more standard wall payload cards {{ smiling_jack }} and {{ constant_revolution }},
    and offers a welcome adaptability to the deck.
</p>
<p>
    The list presented here makes use of {{ shattering }} as a way to put minions in torpor opportunistically,
    but that's merely one of the many options that can be used on top of the solid wall foundations this clan offers.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    The Anarch specific master cards are especially strong here: {{ garibaldi_meucci_museum }} is incredibly versatile,
    from ending troublesome combats with aggressive Anarchs to fetching the required unlock or bounce. It can also
    let you play {{ revolutionary_council }} turn after turn if you need it. {{ powerbase_los_angeles }} acts as 
    cycling device as well as an additional unlock, since there are so many Anarch cards (note cards requiring Barons
    implicitly count as cards requiring Anarch). {{ anarch_railroad }} and {{ the_anarch_free_press }} provide permanent
    stealth and intercept.
</p>
<p>
    {{ society_of_leopold }} is an inclusion specifically linked to the use of {{ shattering }} here, allowing for a
    potential destruction of a cumbersome vampire anywhere on the table after it's been emptied. {{ rewilding }} can be
    used to damage the prey's influence if they play locations, but can also be a good way to get rid of other
    problematic locations, the prime targets being permanent stealth like {{ opium_den }} or {{ creepshow_casino }},
    and {{ hunting_grounds }} that go against the grinding strategy of the deck.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module here is very focused on using {{ earth_meld }} for additional unlocks, but at some point it
    also aims at equipping someone with a {{ sniper_rifle }} to begin to grind beads out of all the blocked minions.
</p>
<p>
    The stealth module is particularily interesting, with a lot of versatiliy. Of course {{ earth_meld }} provides
    steady stealth when needed (to get this {{ revolutionary_council }} or {{ constant_revolution }} through for example),
    but {{ form_of_mist }} and {{ form_of_the_bat }} can both be used either as stealth complement or as additional
    combat avoidance or intercept if needed.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The use of {{ shattering }} is very specific to this version, but it's a great control device.
    {{ monkey_wrench }} or {{ stolen_police_cruiser }} can be included for a bit more bleed, {{ reckless_agitation }}
    often finds a spot, and sometimes even more political actions like {{ domain_challenge }} or
    {{ kine_resources_contested }}. On the equipments side, of course, {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} and {{ ivory_bow }} are
    often included.
</p>
<p>
    There are wild variations in the combat module. The use of weapons like {{ sniper_rifle }} in here is common,
    but can also be dismissed in favor of aggravated damage with {{ donnybrook }} or {{ claws_of_the_dead }}.
    Depending on the combat module, {{ rotschreck }} or {{ gangrel_revel }} can find a spot in the master module.
    A couple of anarch combat cards can find their place too, like {{ groundfighting }} or {{ hell_for_leather }},
    and {{ flesh_of_marble }} makes some appearances as a tool against damage-heavy decks.
</p>
<p>    
    Finally, {{ protection_racket }} is often included in the intercept mix: it is very effective against high stealth
    votes like the ones {{ infernal_princes }} or {{ infernal_ministry }} can display. Some versions don't bother to
    include {{ earth_control }} or {{ anarch_railroad }} for stealth, relying on {{ form_of_the_bat }} and
    {{ form_of_mist }}, plus the dissuading effect of the combat module.
