Introduction
============

The following documentation assumes basic python programming experience.

If you are new to scientific programming in python altogether, `Scientific Python Lectures <https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures>`_ is a great resource to get started.

Data in ERLabPy are mostly represented by :mod:`xarray` objects. The user guide of the `xarray documentation <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html>`_ provides an excellent overview on data manipulation.
