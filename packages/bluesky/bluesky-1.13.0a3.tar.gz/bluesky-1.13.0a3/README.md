The Bluesky Python Package is an experiment specification and orchestration engine. 
- Specify the logic of an experiment in a high-level, hardware-abstracted way.
- First-class support for adaptive feedback between analysis and acquisition.
- Data is emitted in a streaming fashion in standard Python data structures.
- Pause/resume, robust error handling, and rich metadata capture are built in.

The Bluesky Project enables experimental science at the lab-bench or facility scale. It is a collection of Python libraries that are co-developed but independently useful and may be adopted *a la carte*.
