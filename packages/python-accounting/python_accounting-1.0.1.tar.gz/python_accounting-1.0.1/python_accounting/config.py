"""
This module provides the configuration for python accounting. Its properties are populated from 
`config.toml <https://github.com/ekmungai/python-accounting/blob/main/config.toml>`__ by default and 
should be adequate for most settings, but there are a few methods for overriding the database, 
hashing and dates configurations. For more extensive custom configurations, you can initialize 
the class with a custom config.tml file.
