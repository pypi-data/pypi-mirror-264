The [**signac** framework](https://signac.io) helps users manage and scale file-based workflows, facilitating data reuse, sharing, and reproducibility.

The **signac-flow** tool provides the basic components to set up simple to complex workflows for projects managed by the [**signac** framework](https://signac.io).
That includes the definition of data pipelines, execution of data space operations and the submission of operations to high-performance super computers.
