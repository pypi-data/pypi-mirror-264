## [1.0.2] - 2024-03-27

### Changed

* Fix the issue, where the `@stopwatch` decorator, when used on recursive functions,
  would start a new timer for each recursive call. Now, the decorator will only
  start a timer for the first call and return the total time taken by the function
  and all its recursive calls.
