"""Neighborly Character-Driven Social Simulation Framework.

Neighborly is an extensible, data-driven, agent-based modeling framework
designed to simulate towns of characters for games. It is intended to be a
tool for exploring simulationist approaches to character-driven emergent
narratives. Neighborly's simulation architecture is inspired by roguelikes
such as Caves of Qud and Dwarf Fortress.
