# shdw-node-stats

This Python package, `shdw-node-stats`, is designed to fetch and record information about blockchain nodes. It has two features:

1. Retrieve data such as the node's rank, total rewards, and status from a specified API endpoint, then records this information in a CSV file for chart purpose if you need.

2. Send notification to your Telegram when the node status is `not_eligible`.

## Installation

To install `shdw-node-stats` as a package, simply use pip:

```
pip install shdw-node-stats
```

This command installs `shdw-node-stats` along with all required dependencies. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.8 or later is recommended).

## Usage

### As a Standalone Script

If you prefer to use `NodeStats.py` as a standalone script:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.8 or later is recommended) and clone the repository or download the script.

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare a file named `nodes.txt` or `nodes.json` with the node addresses.

4. Run the script from the terminal or command prompt:

```
python3 NodeStats.py
```

### As a Python Package

To install `shdw-node-stats` as a package, simply use pip:

```
pip install shdw-node-stats
```

This command installs `shdw-node-stats` along with all required dependencies. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.8 or later is recommended). After installing `shdw-node-stats` via pip, you can use it in your Python scripts as follows:

1. Prepare a file named `nodes.txt` or `nodes.json` containing the addresses of the nodes you wish to query.

2. Use the package in your script:

```python
from shdw_node_stats import NodeStats

# Assuming you have a 'nodes.txt' or 'nodes.json' file in your current directory
node_stats = NodeStats('nodes.txt')  # or NodeStats('nodes.json')
node_stats.run()
```

This will fetch the node information and output it to a CSV file named `node_rankings.csv`.

## File Formats Supported

- **JSON (.json):** Should contain an array of node addresses.
- **Text (.txt):** Should contain node addresses, one per line.

## Output

Both usage methods generate a CSV file named `node_rankings.csv`, which includes the following columns: Timestamp, Node Address, Rank, Rewards, and Status. The console output will display the node information and the total rewards accumulated by the nodes listed in the input file.
