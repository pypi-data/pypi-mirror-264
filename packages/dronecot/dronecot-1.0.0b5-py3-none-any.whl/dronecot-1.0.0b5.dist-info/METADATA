Display Drones in TAK 
*********************

DroneCOT is software for monitoring and analyzing Direct Remote Identification (DRI), Remote ID (RID) or Open Drone ID (ODID) broadcasts from Uncrewed Aircraft (UA) via the Team Awareness Kit (TAK) ecosystem of products.

DroneCOT captures & reports real-time data received from drones into TAK products using native TAK protocols, including Cursor on Target (CoT). 

DroneCOT has been evaluated with WinTAK, iTAK, ATAK & TAK Server.

DroneCOT is in active use today in a variety of missions.
