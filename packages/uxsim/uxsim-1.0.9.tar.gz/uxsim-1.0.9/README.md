*UXsim* is a free, open-source macroscopic and mesoscopic network traffic flow simulator written in Python.
It simulates the movements of car travelers and traffic congestion in road networks.
It is suitable for simulating large-scale (e.g. city-scale) traffic phenomena.
UXsim would be especially useful for scientific and educational purposes because of its simple, lightweight, and customizable features, but of course users are free to use UXsim for any purpose.

- [Technical Documentation](https://toruseo.jp/UXsim/docs/index.html): Detailed documents on tutorials, simulation mechanism, and specifications of modules/functions

## Main Features

- Simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use Python implementation of the modern standard models of dynamic network traffic flow.
- Traffic flow simulation with a given network and time-dependent OD demand (dynamic traffic assignment).
- Implementation of traffic control/management schemes such as traffic signals and road pricing.
- Basic analysis of simulation results and their export to pandas.DataFrame and CSV files.
- Visualization of simulation results including animation.
- Flexible and customizable thanks to pure Python implementation. Can also be directly integrated with other Python-based frameworks, such as PyTorch for deep reinforcement learning traffic control.

## Simulation Examples

### Large-scale scenario

Belows are simulation result where approximately 60000 vehicles pass through a 10km x 10km grid network in 2 hours. The computation time was about 30 seconds on a standard desktop PC.

Visualization of link traffic states (thicker lines mean more vehicles, darker colors mean slower speeds) and some vehicle trajectories:

</p>

### Deep reinforcement learning signal control using PyTorch

Traffic signal controller is trained by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
The left (or upper) is no control scenario with fixed signal timing; the traffic demand exceeds the network capacity with naive signal setting, and a gridlock occurs.
The right (or bottom) is with DRL control scenario, where traffic signal can be changed by observing queue length; although the demand level is the same, traffic is smoothly flowing.
[Jupyter Notebook of this example](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim/blob/main/demos_and_examples/demo_notebook_03en_pytorch.ipynb) is available.

### Using pip with custom configuration

You can also use `pip` to install the GitHub version:

```
pip install -U -e git+https://github.com/toruseo/uxsim@main#egg=uxsim
```

Or any other (development) branch on this repo or your own fork:

```
pip install -U -e git+https://github.com/YOUR_FORK/uxsim@YOUR_BRANCH#egg=uxsim
```

	
### Manual install

Download the `uxsim` directory from this Github repo or [the latest release](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim/releases/latest/download/uxsim.zip) and place it to your local directory as follows:
```
your_project_directory/
├── uxsim/ 	# The uxsim directory
│ ├── utils/ 	# Utility files of UXsim
│ ├── uxsim.py 	# The main code of UXsim. You can customize this as you wish
│ ├── utils.py 	# Utility funcsions of UXsim
│ └── ... 	# Other files in uxsim
├── your_simulation_code.py 		# Your code if nessesary

## Usage

Import the module using:
```python
from uxsim import *
```
and then define your simulation scenario.

The [Jupyter Notebook Demo](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim/blob/main/demos_and_examples/demo_notebook_01en.ipynb) summarizes the basic usage and features.
You can also test [Google Colab demo](http://colab.research.google.com/github/toruseo/UXsim/blob/main/demos_and_examples/demo_notebook_05en_for_google_colab.ipynb).
For the further details, please see [demos_and_examples](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim/tree/main/demos_and_examples) and [UXsim technical documentation](https://toruseo.jp/UXsim/docs/index.html).

As a simple example, the following code will simulate traffic flow in a Y-shaped network. 
```python
from uxsim import *

# Define the main simulation
# Units are standardized to seconds (s) and meters (m)
W = World(
    name="",    # Scenario name
    deltan=5,   # Simulation aggregation unit delta n
    tmax=1200,  # Total simulation time (s)
    print_mode=1, save_mode=1, show_mode=0,    # Various options
    random_seed=0    # Set the random seed
)

# Define the scenario
W.addNode("orig1", 0, 0) # Create a node
W.addNode("orig2", 0, 2)
W.addNode("merge", 1, 1)
W.addNode("dest", 2, 1)
W.addLink("link1", "orig1", "merge", length=1000, free_flow_speed=20, jam_density=0.2, merge_priority=0.5) # Create a link
W.addLink("link2", "orig2", "merge", length=1000, free_flow_speed=20, jam_density=0.2, merge_priority=2)
W.addLink("link3", "merge", "dest", length=1000, free_flow_speed=20, jam_density=0.2)
W.adddemand("orig1", "dest", 0, 1000, 0.4) # Create OD traffic demand
W.adddemand("orig2", "dest", 500, 1000, 0.6)

# Run the simulation to the end
W.exec_simulation()

# Print summary of simulation result
W.analyzer.print_simple_stats()

# Visualize snapshots of network traffic state for several timesteps
W.analyzer.network(0, detailed=1, network_font_size=0)
W.analyzer.network(500, detailed=1, network_font_size=0)
W.analyzer.network(1000, detailed=1, network_font_size=0)
```

It would output text to the terminal and images to `out` directory like below:
```
