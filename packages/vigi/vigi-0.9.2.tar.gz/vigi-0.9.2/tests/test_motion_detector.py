"""
This file contains tests for the motion detector module and aims to verify that
the motion detector is able to distinguish between videos that contain real motion
and videos that do not contain any real motion

The tests are based on sample videos that are located in the samples directory
The samples directory contains two subdirectories: positive and negative
The positive directory contains videos that contain real motion
The negative directory contains videos that do not contain any real motion, but
rather static scenes with some noise or light changes
