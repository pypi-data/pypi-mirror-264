This python package produces pair plots, otherwise known as corner plots or scatter plot matrices: grids of 1D and 2D histograms that allow you to visualize high dimensional data.

Pair plots are an excellent way to vizualize the results of MCMC simulations, but are also a useful way to vizualize correlations in general data tables.

Read the documentation here: (https://sefffal.github.io/PairPlots.jl/dev/)

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U pairplots
```

The default styles of this package roughly reproduce the output of the Python library [corner.py](https://corner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for a single series, and [chainconsumer.py](https://samreay.github.io/ChainConsumer/usage.html) for multiple series.
If these are not to your tastes, this package is highly configurable.


## Credits
This package is built on top of the great packages Makie.jl, Contour.jl, KernelDensity.jl, and Tables.jl. The overall inspiration and a few lines of code are taken  from corner.py and chainconsumer.py
