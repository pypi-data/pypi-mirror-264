class ProbabilisticModel(abc.ABC):

    Abstract base class for probabilistic models.

    The definition of events follows the definition of events in the random_events package.
    The definition of functions is motivated by the background knowledge provided in the probabilistic circuits.

    This class can be used as an interface to any kind of probabilistic model, tractable or not.
    The methods follow the pattern that methods that begin with `_` use a preprocessed version of the original method.
    This is useful to separating the process of parsing user inputs and the actual calculations.
