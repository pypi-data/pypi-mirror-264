## Note to Users
I made this for my own personal use but it is not limited to that. If there is any suggestions or fixes, raise an issue [here](https://github.com/d33pster/warlockSFX/issues).

The Original pymakeself was made by Andrew Gillis (Around 10 years ago or so). As a lot of users find it hard because it is deprecated, hope this helps :)
