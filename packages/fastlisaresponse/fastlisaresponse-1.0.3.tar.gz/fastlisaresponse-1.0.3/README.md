# fastlisaresponse: Generic LISA response function for GPUs

This code base provides a GPU-accelerated version of the generic time-domain LISA response function. The GPU-acceleration allows this code to be used directly in Parameter Estimation.

Please see the [documentation](https://mikekatz04.github.io/lisa-on-gpu/) for further information on these modules. The code can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/mikekatz04/lisa-on-gpu). It can be found on # TODO fix [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3981654#.XzS_KRNKjlw).

If you use all or any parts of this code, please cite (TODO: fill in ). See the [documentation](https://mikekatz04.github.io/lisa-on-gpu/) to properly cite specific modules.

## Getting Started

Below is a quick set of instructions to get you started with `fastlisaresponse`.

0) [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) if you do not have it.

1) Create a virtual environment. **Note**: There is no available `conda` compiler for Windows. If you want to install for Windows, you will probably need to add libraries and include paths to the `setup.py` file.

```
conda create -n lisa_env -c conda-forge gcc_linux-64 gxx_linux-64 numpy Cython scipy jupyter ipython h5py matplotlib python=3.9
conda activate lisa_env
```

    If on MACOSX, substitute `gcc_linux-64` and `gxx_linus-64` with `clang_osx-64` and `clangxx_osx-64`.

2) Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/mikekatz04/lisa-on-gpu.git
cd lisa-on-gpu
```

3) Run install.

```
python setup.py install
```

4) To import fastlisaresponse:

```
from fastlisaresponse import ResponseWrapper
```

See [examples notebook](https://github.com/mikekatz04/lisa-on-gpu/blob/master/examples/fast_LISA_response_tutorial.ipynb).


### Prerequisites

To install this software for CPU usage, you need Python >3.4 and NumPy. To run the examples, you will also need jupyter and matplotlib. We generally recommend installing everything, including gcc and g++ compilers, in the conda environment as is shown in the examples here. This generally helps avoid compilation and linking issues. If you use your own chosen compiler, you will need to make sure all necessary information is passed to the setup command (see below). You also may need to add information to the `setup.py` file.

To install this software for use with NVIDIA GPUs (compute capability >2.0), you need the [CUDA toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html) and [CuPy](https://cupy.chainer.org/). The CUDA toolkit must have cuda version >8.0. Be sure to properly install CuPy within the correct CUDA toolkit version. Make sure the nvcc binary is on `$PATH` or set it as the `CUDAHOME` environment variable.


### Installing


0) [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) if you do not have it.

1) Create a virtual environment.

```
conda create -n lisa_env -c conda-forge gcc_linux-64 gxx_linux-64 numpy Cython scipy jupyter ipython h5py matplotlib python=3.9
conda activate few_env
```

    If on MACOSX, substitute `gcc_linux-64` and `gxx_linus-64` with `clang_osx-64` and `clangxx_osx-64`.

    If you want a faster install, you can install the python packages (numpy, Cython, scipy, tqdm, jupyter, ipython, h5py, requests, matplotlib) with pip.

2) Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/FastEMRIWaveforms.git
cd FastEMRIWaveforms
```

3) If using GPUs, use pip to [install cupy](https://docs-cupy.chainer.org/en/stable/install.html). If you have cuda version 9.2, for example:

```
pip install cupy-cuda92
```

4) Run install. Make sure CUDA is on your PATH.

```
python setup.py install
```

## Running the Tests

Since the code package in minimal in size, the example notebook should be run to verify it is running correctly.
