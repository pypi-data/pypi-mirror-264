QueryAnonymizer
===============


Description
-----------

`queryanonymizer` is a Python library designed to anonymize SQL, DAX or others languages queries. It allows safe sharing of queries for debugging, documentation, or educational purposes without the risk of exposing sensitive data. The library provides functions for both anonymizing and deanonymizing queries, with support for various SQL dialects and allows using also custom keywords.


Installation
------------

To install `queryanonymizer`, run the following command:


    pip install queryanonymizer

Usage
-----

Import `queryanonymizer` in your Python project and use the provided functions to anonymize or deanonymize your queries/prompts.


    from queryanonymizer import anonymize, deanonymize, keywords_list

    query = """
    SELECT order_id
        , customer_id
        , order_date
        , employee_id
        , customer_name
        , order_value
    FROM order
    WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01'
        AND order_value >= 1000
    """

    anonymized_query, decoder_dictionary, _ = anonymize(query)

    # Example of deanonymizing a query
    deanonymize(anonymized_query, decoder_dictionary)
