# QDD
## About
QDD is a decision diagram based quantum computing simulator.
Memory usage can be significantly reduced compared to typical state vector based simulators.

It works as a Qiskit backend.
At this point, we do not distribute wheel file, so you need to build it locally.

## License
BSD 3-Clause Clear License

## Build
You must prepare the following software.

* cmake (>=3.25)
  * You can download the executable from [Official GitHub](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases).
  * If you use Ubuntu, [the Kitware repository](https://apt.kitware.com/) is easier to install.
* build
  * Just install it via pip.

You can build QDD as follows.
```sh
$ cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ cmake --build . -j
$ python3 -m pip install build
$ python3 -m build
```
BUILD_TYPE can be either `Release`, `Debug` or `RelWithDebInfo`.
You can find an installable wheel file in 'dist' directory.

## Instllation
Please move to your working directory and install the wheel file created in the build phase.
```sh
$ pip install {QDD_DIR}/dist/qdd-XXX.whl
```

## Usage
QDD works as a Qiskit backend.

```py
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.primitives import BackendSampler

from qdd import QddProvider

backend = QddProvider().get_backend()
circ = QuantumCircuit(3)
circ.h(0)
circ.cx(0,1)
circ.measure_all()
sampler = BackendSampler(backend=backend)
qdd_job = sampler.run(circuits=circ)
print(qdd_job.result())
```

QDD has its own implementation of the Sampler class
```py
from qdd.qdd_sampler import Sampler
sampler = Sampler()
qdd_job = sampler.run(circuits=circ)
print(qdd_job.result())
```

If you need statevector, create the backend as follows.
```py
backend = QddProvider().get_backend('statevector_simulator')
```
