# MailTMClient
I would like to bring to your attention the user-friendly MailTMClient package, specifically designed to facilitate seamless communication with the mail.tm API. With its comprehensive set of functions, it emerges as the only Python-based solution out there that fully embraces all the API's offerings. We hope this information will prove useful to you.
My mail.tm console client is based on the MailTMClient and in the [source code of its main.py](https://github.com/RPwnage/binify/blob/main/main.py) file you can see the ease of use of MailTMclient from an example.

## Registering a new Account and logging in

Using the code below, a new account can be created. 

    from MailTMClient import MailTMClient
    (responseCode, response) = MailTMClient().register(args.address, args.password)
        if responseCode == 0:
            print("[i] Successfully created an MailTM Account!")
            saveTokenToFile(response)
        if responseCode != 0:
            print("[!] Failed to create an MailTM Account! (" + str(response) + ")")

Following a successful account creation, the response variable will contain the tokens required for future application access. In order to log in to an existing account, please proceed accordingly.

    (responseCode, response) =  MailTMClient().login(args.address, args.password)
