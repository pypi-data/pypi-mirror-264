# jirate
High-level CLI for Trello and JIRA

# Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`pip install .`

# Notes - Jira
- You must configure your default project, token, and URL by creating ~/.jirate.json
- Whenever operating on your default project, you do not need to include it in operations. In the below examples, if your default project was `MYISSUE`, you could omit it when calling operations on `MYISSUE-123` and simply provide `123`
- Project keys are case insensitive from the CLI; they are automatically translated to upper-case.

# Examples - Jira
- cat (print) a task:
  - `jirate cat MYISSUE-123`
  - `jirate cat -v MYISSUE-123`
  - `jirate -p myissue cat 123`
- View an issue in your browser (xdg-open):
  - `jirate view MYISSUE-123`
  - `jirate -p myissue view 123`
- Create new Task. This spawns an editor. First line is your summary, the third lines and subsequent become the description:
  - `jirate new`
