    Attributes
    ----------
    offset : int
        Position of record in input file/stream. This is useful for
        debugging and finding the location of records in the original
        file.

    length : int
        Length of record.

    os_control : bytes
        Two bytes reserved for OS usage (OS Control bytes).

    delete_code : bytes
        Deletion Code Field (one byte).

    type : chr
        Type of the record in ASCII (decoded from EBCDIC).

    raw : bytes
        Binary representation of the entire record.

def read(io, fixed_physical_record_length=None, ascii_record_length=False):
    """Read logical records from a binary stream or file.

    This function reads all logical records from all physical records
    in the provided input.

    Logical records are blocked into *physical records* (also known as
    blocks) that contain multiple logical records. The length of
    physical records is encoded in the first four bytes of the
    physical record.

    In some cases the first four bytes indicating the length of the
    physical record is not present, instead blocks have a fixed
    size. This can be set with `fixed_physical_record_length`.

    In some cases the logical record lenght is encoded as ASCII
    digits. The argument `ascii_record_length` can be set to read
    logical record lenght as ASCII digits.

    The function will check if the first four characters are valid
    ASCII digits. If this is the case, `ascii_record_length` will be
    automatically set to `True` and `fixed_physical_record_length` to
    `1004`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    io : io.RawIOBase
        File from where to read Logical Records. Must be seekable.

    fixed_physical_record_length: None | int
        If specified

    ascii_record_length: bool

    Yields
    ------
