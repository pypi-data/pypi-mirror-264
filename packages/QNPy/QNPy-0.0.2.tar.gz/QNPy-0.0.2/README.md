Introduction
============
In exploring the diverse features of quasar light curves, a significant challenge arises from recurring gaps in observations, which pose a primary limitation. This obstacle, compounded by the inherent irregularities in data collection cadences, presents a formidable barrier. This complexity will be particularly pronounced when dealing with data that is going to come from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), featuring seasonal gaps. Existing strategies, while effective, entail substantial computational costs. To address the complex nature of quasar light curve modeling, our package QNPy has been developed to efficiently model quasar light curves using Conditional Neural Processes.

Conditional Neural Processes
----------------------------

Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) are a type of neural network architecture designed for flexible and probabilistic function learning. They are particularly well-suited for tasks involving conditional predictions and have applications in areas like regression, classification, and generative modeling.

The core idea behind CNPs is to learn a distribution over functions conditioned on input-output pairs. They are capable of making predictions not only for specific inputs seen during training but also for new inputs that were not present in the training data.

The CNP is a model designed for analyzing continuous-time light curves, characterized by time instances (x) and corresponding fluxes (or magnitudes) (y). In the CNP framework, we consider a scenario where we have target inputs representing time instances with unknown magnitudes. In the training process, we leverage a set of context points derived from observations, consisting of time instances (x) and observed magnitudes (y). Each pair in the context set is locally encoded using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The resulting local encodings (Rc) are then aggregated through mean pooling to form a global representation (R). The global representation (R) is a condensed feature representation of the entire context set. This representation, along with the target input (xt), is fed into a decoder MLP. The decoder produces the mean and variance of the predictive distribution for the target output.

Key features of Conditional Neural Processes include:

1. **Conditional Predictions**: CNPs can provide predictions for a target output given a set of input-output pairs, allowing for context-aware predictions.

2. **Flexibility**: CNPs are versatile and can adapt to various types of data and tasks. They are not limited to a specific functional form, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.

3. **Probabilistic Outputs**: CNPs provide uncertainty estimates in the form of predictive distributions. This makes them valuable in situations where uncertainty quantification is crucial.

4. **Scalability**: CNPs can handle different input and output dimensions, making them scalable to various data types and problem complexities.

In summary, Conditional Neural Processes are a powerful framework for conditional function learning that offers flexibility, probabilistic predictions, and scalability across different tasks. They have shown effectiveness in tasks such as few-shot learning, meta-learning, and regression with uncertainty estimation, making them a great tool for modeling the light curves of quasars.

Self Organizing Maps 
--------------------

Conditional Neural Processes excel at learning complex patterns in data with recurring gaps. However, application to larger datasets requires novel methods to prioritize efficiency and effectively capture subtle trends in the data. Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) provide both these advantages. SOMs provide an unsupervised clustering algorithm that can be trained quickly and include new data points without the need to train over every data point again. Thus, we present QNPy as an ensemble model of SOMs and CNPs.

SOMs comprise a network of nodes mapped onto a (usually) two-dimensional grid. Each node has an input weight associated with it. As the SOM trains on the input data, each input point is assigned a Best Matching Unit (BMU) where the node is at the minimum Euclidean distance from the input. Then, the BMU is updated to match the input data point (the amount that the node moves is dependent on the learning rate). Furthermore, each node can affect neighboring nodes via a neighborhood function (usually Gaussian). 

Once the training is ended, each input data point is assigned to a cluster depending on the final BMU. Thus at the end, each node provides a cluster. These can be the final cluster or the distance matrix (a matrix containing the distance of each node with each of the other nodes) of the SOM can be used to group different nodes into more hierarchical clusters. This is done by calculating gradients between the nodes until the lowest node is reached. (For more info, refer to [Hamel and Brown](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/faculty/hamel/pubs/improved-umat-dmin11.pdf)).

In QNPy, we treat each light curve as a data point and the magnitudes are the features. Thus, the SOM can effectively parse topological differences in the light curves. These differences allow the CNP to train on similar light curves and effectively capture subtle differences in the modeled light curves. In addition, the clusters now allow for CNPs to be trained in parallel on smaller batches of data, which allows for a massive speed-up in the training time of the QNPy package.

The SOM is based on the [minisom package](https://github.com/JustGlowing/minisom) which uses NumPy packages to handle the input data. Thus, every input data point must have the same length. We handle this similarly with the CNP by padding all the light curves to the same length. We also scale the light curves to treat different magnitude ranges differently.

Thus, SOMs provide a useful companion to the CNPs to form an ensemble model with improved speed and accuracy in modeling large amounts of light curve data.

Installation
============

To install QNPy, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install QNPy

Requirements
------------

This package contains a `requirements.txt` file with all the dependencies that need to be satisfied before you can use it as a standalone package. To install all requirements at once, navigate to the directory where you downloaded your package (where the `requirements.txt` file is) and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

You are now ready to use the QNPy package.

Special note: If you have python >3.9 on your local machine you will encounter some requirements conflicts with torch and numpy versions. In this case, we recomend creating a virtual enviroment using conda:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n myenv python=3.9

then you have to activate the virtuel enviroment:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate "The name of your virtuel enviroment"

After virtual enviroment is activated you can install QNPy and the requirements.txt file in your newly created enviroment.

.. code-block:: virtual enviroment

    pip install QNPy

.. code-block:: virtual enviroment

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Examples
========

Check out the `Tutorial` folder [here](https://github.com/kittytheastronaut/QNPy-0.0.2) for notebooks that guide you through the process of using this package. There will be teo tutorial folders. The "QNPy without clustering: Tutorial" folder includes examples for using each of the modules separately. Additionally, you'll find an example of how your light curves should look in the `Light_curves` folder. The "QNPy with clustering: Tutorial" folder includes examples for using the Clustering_with_SOM module for single band and multiband clustering. You will also find example of how your light curves should look like in the folders `Light_curves` and `Light_curves_Multiband`.

Folder Structure
================

The QNPy automatically creates folders for saving plots, data and saves your trained SOM and CNP. The only requirement for the file structure in SOM module is to save light curves before the module and choose directories to save plots and models during the module's runtime. The files can be saved under any folder as desired and the file name can be given as an input into the loading function.

In the case of multi-band light curves only, the light curves should be saved under a directory (can be named anything) with the filters saved as subfolders. Then, each light curve should be saved as a CSV file with the id as the file name. For example, if you have a light curve in the g filter with ID 10422 and you want to save it in a folder known as `Light_Curves`, it should be saved under the directory `Light_Curves/g/10422.csv`. This is the standard recommendation for multi-band data. Then, once the clusters are created, it is easy to either point QNPy to one of the filters of a cluster or to manually flatten the file and provide all the light curves to QNPy. However, QNPy does not yet support explicit multi-band clustering.

For all QNPy modules, your data must contain: `mjd` - MJD or time, `mag` - magnitude, and `magerr` - magnitude error.

Before running the script, you can manually create the following folders in the directory where your Python notebook is located:

1. `./preproc/` - for saving the transformed data
2. `./padded_lc/` - for saving the padded light curves
3. `./dataset/train/`, `./dataset/test/`, `./dataset/val/` - for organizing your dataset
4. `./output/prediction/test/data/`, `./output/prediction/test/plots/` - for organizing prediction results
5. `./output/prediction/train/data/`, `./output/prediction/train/plots/` - for organizing training results
6. `./output/prediction/val/data/`, `./output/prediction/val/plots/` - for organizing validation results

Modules and Their Functions
===========================

 **Clustering with SOM**

   **`Clustering_with_SOM.py`**

   In the clustering module, we first load the light curves from the directory. This also creates the ids from the file names. Thus, it is recommended to have the same light curves saved across all the different bands. Then, we pad the light curves to make them all the same length. In QNPy, we have seen that we require at least 100 data points for accurate modeling. Thus, we recommend that the light curves be padded to at least 100 points (even if the longest curve is under 100 points, which can be controlled through a keyword in the padding function). Finally, we scale the light curves. We have provided many different scalers including minmax, standard and robust scalers. Our `default` scaler is an adapted version of a minmax scaler that scales all the data to the range [-2,2].

   Then, a SOM is trained on the scaled data. The SOM contains different tunable hyperparameters to better adapt to different data sets. These hyperparameters can be tested with different metrics including quantization error, topographical error, silhouette score, davies-bouldin index, or calinski-harabasz score. The trained SOM can be saved as well.

   The trained SOM is then used to assign the IDs to different clusters. Then they can be saved into different folders.

   We also provide different plots for visualization of the data. These will be described in the plotting functions.

 **Preprocessing the Data**

   **`Preprocess.py`**

   In this module, we transform data in the range [-2,2]x[-2,2] to make training faster. This module also contains two functions for cleaning the sample from outliers. If your sample does not require outlier cleaning, the functions can be skipped. Also, you can use your designed outlier cleaning function according to your data requirements. This module also contains a function for padding light curves. This function does not need to be used if your light curves have 100 or more points. It is important to emphasize that all light curves must have the same number of points in order to train the model correctly. By testing the package, we found that it is best to do backward padding with the last measured value up to 100 points. You use the padded light curves to train the model, and later, for prediction and plotting, these points are subtracted. According to the needs of the user, another method for padding can be done. The data transformation function in this module also creates subsets of the data named your_curve_name plus and your_curve_name_minus. These subsets are made with respect to errors in magnitudes and serve to augment the model's training set. The original curves are saved as the name_of_your_curve_original.

   Before running this script, you must create the following folders in the directory where your Python notebook is located:

   1. `./preproc/` - It is going to be the folder for saving the transformed data
   2. `./padded_lc/` - It is going to be the folder for saving the padded light curves
   3. `./light_curves_clean/` - It is going to be the folder for saving the light curves that are cleaned from outliers (this can be scipped)

   Your data must contain: `mjd` - MJD or time, `mag` - magnitude, and `magerr` - magnitude error

   **`TRAINING`** 

   Special note for mac os users: 

   When creating folders with mac operating systems, hidden `.DS_Store` files may be created. The user must delete these files before starting training from each folder. The best way is to go into each folder individually and run the command:

   .. code-block:: python

         !rm -f .DS_Store

   Important note: Deleting files using the `delete` directly in the folders does not remove hidden files.

   Before running the training function you must define:

         DATA_PATH_VAL = "./dataset/val" - path to val folder

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**Q** What should my input data look like?

A: The input data should have three columns: mjd - Modified Julian Date or time, mag - magnitude, and magerr - magnitude error

**Q** Do I need to run all four prediction modules?

A: No, it is enough to run only one prediction module, depending on what you want on the final plots. There are four options for prediction and plotting namely:

1. all curves are plotted separately and plots contain transformed data.
2. all curves are plotted in one pdf document and contain transformed data
3. all curves are plotted separately and the plots contain the original data.
4. all curves are plotted in one pdf document and contain original data

**Q** Can the package be used for other uses outside of astronomy?

A: Yes, the package can be used for different types of time series analysis.
