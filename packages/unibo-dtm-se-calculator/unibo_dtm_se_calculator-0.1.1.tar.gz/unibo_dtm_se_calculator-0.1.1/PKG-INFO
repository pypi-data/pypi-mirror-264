# Calculator

A simple calculator toolkit written in Python, with several UIs.

## Remarks

UI code is clearly separated from the business logic. 
Actually, two sorts of UIs are provided: a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI), 
based on [Kivy](https://kivy.org/).

## Requirements and dependencies

You only need [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), any other dependency is managed by it.

Just ensure you have Poetry installed. 
To do that, open a shell and run the following command:

```bash
pip install poetry
```
