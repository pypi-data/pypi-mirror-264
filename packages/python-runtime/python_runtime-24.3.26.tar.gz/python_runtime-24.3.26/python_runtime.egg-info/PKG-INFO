# Python Runtime (Expiration Checker)

`python_runtime` is a Python package providing middleware for FastAPI applications that restricts access to the service past a specified expiration date. The expiration date is dynamically determined based on the package version, following the format `YY.M.DD`, where `YY` is the year, `M` is the month, and `DD` is the day.

## Installation

To install `python_runtime`, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install python_runtime
