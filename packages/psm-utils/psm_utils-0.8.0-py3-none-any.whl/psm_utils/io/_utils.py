    Sets the maximum field size limit for reading CSV files.

    This function sets the maximum field size limit for reading CSV files using the `csv` module.
    It attempts to set the limit to the maximum integer value (`sys.maxsize`), and if an `OverflowError`
    occurs, it reduces the limit by dividing it by 10 until it can be set successfully.

    Note:
        This function should be called before reading any CSV files to ensure that the field size limit
        is properly set.
