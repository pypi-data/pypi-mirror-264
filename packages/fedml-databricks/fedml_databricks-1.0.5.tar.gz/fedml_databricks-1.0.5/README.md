## Introduction

The SAP Federated ML Python library for Databricks applies the Data Federation architecture of SAP Datasphere for intelligently sourcing SAP as well as non-SAP data for Machine Learning experiments done in Databricks, thereby removing the need for replicating or moving the data. By abstracting the Data Connection, Data load, Model Deployment in SAP environment, and Inferencing for Machine learning processes , the FedML Databricks library provides end to end integration with few lines of code.

## Installation

Install the SAP FedML Databricks library using pip as follows:
