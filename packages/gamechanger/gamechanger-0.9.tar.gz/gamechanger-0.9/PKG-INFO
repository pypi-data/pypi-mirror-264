## **Example Usage:**
This ReadMe provides a basic example demonstrating the usage of `gamechanger` classes to create a simple game window with a button and an image:

```py
from gamechanger import GameWindow, Button, Image, AssetManager

# Create a new game window
game_window = GameWindow("Student Game", 800, 600)

# Asset manager
asset_manager = AssetManager()
asset_manager.load_asset("player_image", "img.png")

# UI elements
button = Button(350, 250, 200, 50, "Click me!", lambda: print("Button clicked!"))
image = Image(100, 100, "player_image", asset_manager)

# Add elements to the game window
game_window.add_element(button)
game_window.add_element(image)

# Run the game loop
game_window.run()
```
