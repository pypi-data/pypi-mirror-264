# zeroSharp 0.0.1
# A programming language for all starter programmers, made on Python.

This is a language, that I'm testing, so I may show my best on being programmer!
It haves such functions, such as maths, terminal, painting (supported by turtle), websites (supported by urllib3 & requests) and more!

Language zeroSharp is created for fun, so expect it may get out of support, lag, give you 55 errors, and more!
Also, please, don't use it on serious work! It may result get your stuff ruined.
