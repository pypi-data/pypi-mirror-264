# pymacnet

`pymacnet` is a Python module that provides cycler and channel level interfaces for communication and control of [Maccor cyclers](http://www.maccor.com/) via MacNet. MacNet is an interface provided by Maccor that allows for controlling their cyclers via UDP/IP and TCP/IP. `pymacnet` provides a hassle-free way to utilize MacNet with a simple python class.

## Motivation

Why did we create `pymacnet`? This package enables a wide variety of applications such as:

- Real-time data logging, monitoring and alerting

`pymacnet` can be used to passively monitor running tests and log readings directly to a database, bypassing the need to manually export data. Moreover, it's possible to create automated alerts based on incoming real-time data. For example, if a test were to fault or temperature were to exceed a set threshold. While Maccor already has a built-in notification system with MacNotify, `pymacnet` provides a more flexible and customizable solution without having to directly modify test procedures.

- Automated test management

The GUI provided by Maccor for test management is straight-forward and easy to use, but requires significant manual work. With `pymacnet` it is possible to write programs to automatically start tests simultaneously across many channels (or even many cyclers) at once.

- Testing of next generation closed-loop charging methods

While conventional constant-current followed by constant-voltage (CCCV) charging has been the industry standard for many years and is well supported by cyclers, there is movement towards advanced [closed-loop control charging techniques that provide improved battery life and decreased charge times](https://battgenie.life/technology/). `pymacnet` enables testing of closed-loop battery charging methods by providing an interface between software hosting battery charging algorithms and active Maccor tests, allowing the charge current to be dynamically set.

- Well tested, easy to use, community supported interface in the most popular programming language.

It is entirely possible to write one's own MacNet wrapper, but `pymacnet` provides a well-tested ready to use package that takes care of lower level communication, providing a simple yet powerful interface in the most popular programming language.

## Installation

### Requirements

`pymacnet` requires only Python 3 and packages from the standard library. It has been tested on on Windows, Mac, and Debian operating systems.

### Installation Instructions

Install pymacnet using pip:

```sh
pip install pymacnet
```

Install pymacnet from source code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BattGenie/pymacnet.git
cd pymacnet
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

## Examples

This section goes over various examples of how to use `pymacnet` to do such tasks as getting channel readings, starting a test, and even controlling a channel directly without a test procedure. For interactive examples see the `demo.ipynb` notebook in the repository.

### Getting Started

`pymacnet` provides two classes for interacting with a Maccor cycler:

- `CyclerInterface` Provides a cycler level interface. The class instance allows for reading cycler level information, such as system software and configuration information, and statuses of all channels.

- `ChannelInterface` Provides a channel level interface for a specific channel on the cycler. `ChannelInterface` is a child class of `CyclerInterface` so all the same cycler level methods are available, but with `ChannelInterface` it's possible to read more detailed information about a channel and even even control it. Each class instance targets a specific channel of the cycler.

#### CyclerInterface Configuration

The fields required in a `CyclerInterface` configuration dictionary are as follows:

- `server_ip` - The IP address of the Maccor server. Use 127.0.0.1 if running on the same machine as the server.
- `json_msg_port` - The port to communicate through with JSON messages. Default set to 57570.
- `bin_msg_port` - The port to communicate through with binary messages. Default set to 57560.
- `msg_buffer_size_bytes` - How big of a message buffer to use for sending/receiving messages. A minimum of 1024 bytes is recommended. 

#### ChannelInterface Configuration

The fields required in a `ChannelInterface` configuration dictionary are as follows:

- `server_ip` - The IP address of the Maccor server. Use 127.0.0.1 if running on the same machine as the server.
- `json_msg_port` - The port to communicate through with JSON messages. Default set to 57570.
- `bin_msg_port` - The port to communicate through with binary messages. Default set to 57560.
- `msg_buffer_size_bytes` - How big of a message buffer to use for sending/receiving messages. A minimum of 1024 bytes is recommended. 
- `channel` - The channel to be targeted for all operations.
- `test_name` - The test name to be used for any tests started. If left blank, Maccor will generate a unique random name for any started tests. Note that Maccor requires unique test names for each test.
- `test_procedure` - The test procedure to be used, if starting a test with a procedure. Not needed with direct control.
- `c_rate_ah` - The capacity value to be referenced when setting "C" values within the Maccor schedule. Units of amp-hours. Ignored if not used anywhere in the test.
- `v_max_safety_limit_v` - Upper voltage safety limit for the channel. Units of volts.
- `v_min_safety_limit_v` - Lower voltage safety limit for the channel. Units of volts.
- `i_max_safety_limit_a` - Upper current safety limit for the channel. Units of amps.
- `i_min_safety_limit_a` - Lower current safety limit for the channel. Units of amps.
- `power_safety_limit_chg_w` - The power safety limit for charge. Units of watts.
- `power_safety_limit_dsg_w` - The power safety limit for discharge. Units of watts.
- `v_max_v` - Upper voltage limit used for charge/CV limits. Units of volts. Only used with direct control.
- `v_min_v` - Lower voltage limit used for discharge limit. Units of volts. Only used with direct control.
- `data_record_time_s` - How often data points are taken during direct control tests. Zero turns off. Used only for direct control.
- `data_record_voltage_delta_vbys` - The dV/dt at which data points are taken during direct control tests. Zero disables. Used only for direct control.
- `data_record_current_delta_abys` - The dI/dt at which data points are taken during direct control tests. Zero disables. Used only for direct control.

### Getting Cycler Level Information

Here is some example code for getting cycler level readings with the `CyclerInterface` class. 

```python
import time
import sys
import pymacnet 

config = {
    "server_ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "json_msg_port": 57570,
    "bin_msg_port": 57560,
    "msg_buffer_size_bytes": 1024
}
    
cycler_interface = pymacnet.CyclerInterface(config)
if not channel_interface.start():
    sys.exit("failed to create connection!")

system_info = cycler_interface.read_system_info()
print(system_info)

general_info = cycler_interface.read_general_info()
print(general_info)

channel_statuses = cycler_interface.read_all_channel_statuses()
print(channel_statuses)
```

Example output:

```text
{'FClass': 1, 'FNum': 1, 'APIVersion': 1, 'MacTest32EXEversionMajor': 3, 'MacTest32EXEversionMinor': 2, 'MacTest32EXEversionBuild': 18 'MacTest32DLLversionMajor': 3, 'MacTest32DLLversionMsinor': 2, 'MacTest32DLLversionBuild': 18, 'MacTest32ExeDT': '2016-11-08T15:02:58', 'MacTest32DLLDT': '2016-11-13T11:29:48'}
```

```text
{'FClass': 1, 'FNum': 2, 'SystemID': 'Win10', 'SystemType': 0, 'ControllerBoards': 3, 'TestChannels': 12, 'AuxBoards': 1, 'AuxChannels': 128, 'SMB1Pos': 0, 'SMB3Pos': 1}
```

```text
[{'RF1': 0, 'RF2': 0, 'Stat': 0}, {'RF1': 0, 'RF2': 0, 'Stat': 0}]
```

### Getting Channel Readings

Below is example code for reading channel status (which includes voltage, current, etc.) from channel 75.

```python
import time
import sys
import pymacnet 

config = {
    "server_ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "json_msg_port": 57570,
    "bin_msg_port": 57560,
    "msg_buffer_size_bytes": 1024
    "channel": 75,
    "test_name": "",
    "c_rate_ah": 1,
    "v_max_v": 4.2,
    "v_min_v": 3.0,
    "v_max_safety_limit_v": 4.25,
    "v_min_safety_limit_v": 2.9,
    "i_max_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "i_min_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "power_safety_limit_chg_w": 25,
    "power_safety_limit_dsg_w": 25,
    "data_record_time_s": 0.05,
    "data_record_voltage_delta_vbys": 0.0,
    "data_record_current_delta_abys": 0.0,
    "test_procedure": "test_procedure_1",
}
    
channel_interface = pymacnet.ChannelInterface(config)
if not channel_interface.start():
    sys.exit("failed to create connection!")

status_reading = channel_interface.read_channel_status()
print(status_reading)
```

Example output:

```text
{'FClass': 4, 'FNum': 7, 'Chan': 1, 'RF1': 0, 'RF2': 192, 'Stat': 0, 'LastRecNum': 4225, 'Cycle': 0, 'Step': 5, 'TestTime': 2.0, 'StepTime': 1.0, 'Capacity': 0, 'Energy': 0, 'Current': 0, 'Voltage': 3.85, 'TesterTime': '2022-10-13T12:32:56'}
```

### Starting a Test

Here is in example of how to start a test named "simple_test_1" on channel 75 with an existing test procedure named "test_procedure_1". Note the safety limits defined in the config will be set on the channel before starting the test. Also, test names must be unique. If a non-unique test name is provided then the test will not start. If no test name is provided then a unique random test name is generated.

```python
import pymacnet
import sys

config = {
    "server_ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "json_msg_port": 57570,
    "bin_msg_port": 57560,
    "msg_buffer_size_bytes": 1024
    "channel": 75,
    "test_name": "simple_test_1",
    "c_rate_ah": 1,
    "v_max_v": 4.2,
    "v_min_v": 3.0,
    "v_max_safety_limit_v": 4.25,
    "v_min_safety_limit_v": 2.9,
    "i_max_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "i_min_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "power_safety_limit_chg_w": 25,
    "power_safety_limit_dsg_w": 25,
    "data_record_time_s": 0.05,
    "data_record_voltage_delta_vbys": 0.0,
    "data_record_current_delta_abys": 0.0,
    "test_procedure": "test_procedure_1",
}
channel_interface = pymacnet.ChannelInterface(config_dict)
if not channel_interface.start():
    sys.exit("failed to create connection!")

if channel_interface.start_test_with_procedure():
    print("Test started!")
```

### Setting Variables

Here is an example of how to set VAR1 to 0.01 on a test running on channel 75.

```python
import pymacnet
import sys

config = {
    "server_ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "json_msg_port": 57570,
    "bin_msg_port": 57560,
    "msg_buffer_size_bytes": 1024
    "channel": 75,
    "test_name": "",
    "c_rate_ah": 1,
    "v_max_v": 4.2,
    "v_min_v": 3.0,
    "v_max_safety_limit_v": 4.25,
    "v_min_safety_limit_v": 2.9,
    "i_max_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "i_min_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "power_safety_limit_chg_w": 25,
    "power_safety_limit_dsg_w": 25,
    "data_record_time_s": 0.05,
    "data_record_voltage_delta_vbys": 0.0,
    "data_record_current_delta_abys": 0.0,
    "test_procedure": "test_procedure_1",
}

channel_interface = pymacnet.ChannelInterface(config_dict)
if not channel_interface.start():
    sys.exit("failed to create connection!")

channel_interface.set_channel_variable(var_num = 1, var_value = 0.01)
```

### Direct Control

Here is an example of how to bypass using a test procedure all together and control the channel directly using direct control.  Note the channel safety limits will be set before the test is started. **WARNING DIRECT CONTROL IS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS. BE CAREFUL AND MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOUR CODE IS DOING.**

```python
import pymacnet
import sys

config = {
    "server_ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "json_msg_port": 57570,
    "bin_msg_port": 57560,
    "msg_buffer_size_bytes": 1024
    "channel": 75,
    "test_name": "",
    "c_rate_ah": 1,
    "v_max_v": 4.2,
    "v_min_v": 3.0,
    "v_max_safety_limit_v": 4.25,
    "v_min_safety_limit_v": 2.9,
    "i_max_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "i_min_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "power_safety_limit_chg_w": 25,
    "power_safety_limit_dsg_w": 25,
    "data_record_time_s": 0.05,
    "data_record_voltage_delta_vbys": 0.0,
    "data_record_current_delta_abys": 0.0,
    "test_procedure": "test_procedure_1",
}

channel_interface = pymacnet.ChannelInterface(config_dict)
if not channel_interface.start():
    sys.exit("failed to create connection!")

if channel_interface.start_test_with_direct_control():
    print("Test started!")
else:
    sys.exit("Failed to start test!")

time.sleep(1) # Must wait at least 100 ms between trying to set control

# Discharge at 200 mA for 5 seconds. 
channel_interface.set_direct_mode_output(current_a = -0.200)
time.sleep(5)

# Rest for 5 seconds
channel_interface.set_direct_mode_output(current_a = 0)
time.sleep(5) 

# Charge at 200 mA for 5 seconds
channel_interface.set_direct_mode_output(current_a = 0.200)
time.sleep(5)

channel_interface.set_direct_mode_output(current_a = 0.0)
time.sleep(1)
```

## Development

This section contains various information to help developers further extend and test `pymacnet`

### Contributing

As it exists now, `pymacnet` only implements a fraction of the messages supported by MacNet. Further work can be done to expand `pymacnet` to include more of the messages detailed in the MacNet documentation `docs/macnet_from_maccor_help.pdf`.

We welcome your help in expanding `pymacnet`! Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/BattGenie/pymacnet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in this repository for contribution guidelines.

### Testing

To run the tests navigate to the "tests" directory and type the following:

```sh
pytest .
```

#### MaccorSpoofer

Testing software on a real cycler is dangerous so we've created a submodule `maccorspoofer` to emulate some of the behavior of the Maccor software with a class `MaccorSpoofer`. This class creates TCP and UDP servers and accepts connections from n number of clients. The `MaccorSpoofer` does not perfectly emulate a Maccor cycler (for example, it does not track if a test is already running on a channel) and merely checks that the message format is correct and responds with standard message. Example usage of MaccorSpoofer is documented in the file [demo_maccorspoofer.ipynb](./demo_maccorspoofer.ipynb) and a video demonstration for the same can be found [here](https://www.loom.com/share/5895a2ea83e2439b81a92b1d00cf639e?sid=e2f509c8-55e3-4b9f-9307-8f7d7b8fcb68).

### Documentation

All documentation was generated with [pydoc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html). To re-generate the documentation type the following command from the top level directory of the repository:

```sh
pydoc --html .
```
