Start test with direct control

Selects the test channel to be started. The test name and procedure name can be up to 250 characters long.
Also, do not select the channel in advance of starting the test. The JSON Start test command will both select and
start the channel. If, however, multiple channels should be started with the same test, do first select the channels,
then start the test using 65535, meaning "all selected".

Parameters as follows:

`TestName` Up to 25 ascii characters for the data file name. “Random” will generate a pseudo-random name.
The field is fixed in length, so remaining characters should be space characters.

`ProcName` Up to 25 ascii characters for the test procedure name. The test procedure must exist in the
C:\\Maccor\\Procedure folder and the “.000” should not be part of the name. The field is fixed in length,
so remaining characters should be space characters.

`Comment` Up to 80 characters for the test comment. The field is fixed in length,
so remaining characters should be space characters.

`Crate` C-rate. If C-rate is not used, enter 1.

`ChamberNum` Environmental chamber number. If the environmental chamber is not used, enter 0.

`StartCycle` Default: 0; See Start Test Setup for further details

`TotCycles` Default: 0; See Start Test Setup for further details

`Mass` Default: 1; See Start Test Setup for further details

`VGain` Default: 0; Used to change the gain of the constant voltage feedback loop. Only use it after consulting Customer Service.
0: Gain x1 1: Gain x2 2: Gain x4 3: Gain x8 4: Gain /1 5: Gain /2 6: Gain /4 7: Gain /8

`AbsTRepAlign` Default: 0; 1: Use absolute time report alignment. See Start Test Setup for further details

`ParallelR` See Start Test Setup for further details

Start direct mode test.

Start direct mode. Initializes direct remote control of the test channel with the
following data in the “Data” area. The channel will output this current, voltage
and power - mutually limiting as standard - until the values are changed with the
“(6, 8) Set direct output” command described below or stopped.

A watchdog timer can be activated in the Misc_Options section of the System.ini file. Setting the
MacNetDirectModeWD to a value higher than 0 will cause a channel under direct mode to suspend if it
has not been updated within the specified number of seconds.

Parameters are as follows:

`testName` Up to 25 ascii characters for the data file name. “Random” (Case sensitive) will
generate a pseudo-random name. The field is fixed in length, so remaining characters should be space characters.

`Current` Amps. Mutually limiting. Set outside range to ignore. 0 is within range.
Must be active to function in (6, 8) Set direct mode output.

`Voltage` Voltage. Mutually limiting. Set outside range to ignore. 0 is within range.
Must be active to function in (6, 8) Set direct mode output.

`Power` Watts. Mutually limiting. Set outside range to ignore. 0 is within range.
Must be active to function in (6, 8) Set direct mode output.

`Resistance`  Ohms. Mutually limiting. Set to 0 to ignore.
Must be active to function in (6, 8) Set direct mode output.

`CurrentRange` The desired current range: 1, 2, 3, 4

`ChMode` Charge mode. 67 i.e. 'C' for charge, 68 i.e. 'D' for discharge and 82 i.e. 'R' for rest

`DataTime` Data record time. Time increment between data records in the data file. Enter 0 for no data.
Data record voltage

`DataV` `Voltage increment to generate a data record in the data file. Enter 0 to disable.
Data record current

`DataI` Current increment to generate a data record in the data file. Enter 0 to disable.
