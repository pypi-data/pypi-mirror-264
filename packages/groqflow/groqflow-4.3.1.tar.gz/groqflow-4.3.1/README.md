# GroqFlow ðŸš€

GroqFlowâ„¢ is the easiest way to get started with Groq's technology. GroqFlow provides an automated workflow for compiling Machine Learning, Artifical Intelligence, and High-Performance Computing workloads into Groq programs and executing those programs on the Groq Language Processing Unitâ„¢ (LPU).

## Contributors

GroqFlow development is primarily conducted within Groq's internal repo and is periodically synced to GitHub. This approach means that developer contributions are not immediately obvious in the commit log.

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org) specification.
