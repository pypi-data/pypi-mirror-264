# Migrating from DC script

To maintain compatibility with your current folders, make sure to modify the metadata option within the config file. Additionally, configure the save_path, dir_path, and filename settings to generate outputs that align with your existing setup.

The inherited metadata files from DIGITALCRIMINALS' script play a crucial role in preventing redundant downloads by acting as a check for duplicates.

For comprehensive guidance on making these adjustments, you can refer to the provided resources
