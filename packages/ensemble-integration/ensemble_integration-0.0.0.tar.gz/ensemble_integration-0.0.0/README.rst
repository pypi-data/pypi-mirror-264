``ensemble-integration``: Integrating multi-modal data for predictive modeling
==============================================================================

``ensemble-integration`` (or ``eipy``) leverages multi-modal data to build classifiers using a late fusion approach. 
In eipy, base predictors are trained on each modality before being ensembled at the late stage. 

This implementation of eipy can utilize `sklearn-like <https://scikit-learn.org/>`_ models only, therefore, for unstructured data,
e.g. images, it is recommended to perform feature selection prior to using eipy. We hope to allow for a wider range of base predictors, 
i.e. deep learning methods, in future releases. A key feature of ``eipy`` is its built-in nested cross-validation approach, allowing for a 
fair comparison of a collection of user-defined ensemble methods.

Documentation including tutorials are available at `https://eipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ <https://eipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Installation
------------

As usual it is recommended to set up a virtual environment prior to installation. 
You can install ensemble-integration with pip:

``pip install ensemble-integration``
