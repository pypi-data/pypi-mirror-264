# Getting Started — Installation
## Microsoft Windows
- For Windows 7 and above, download and execute the latest **[NSIS installer](https://gitlab.com/william.belanger/storage/-/raw/primenote/primenote-1.5.1.exe?inline=false)**

## Arch Linux
- Install `primenote-git` from the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/primenote-git) (AUR)
- To enable `console` and `vim` modes, install `qtermwidget` and `gvim` community packages.

## Debian Linux
As a convenience, a one-step install script is provided. As piping unknown scripts to bash is a controversial topic, use the manual installation procedure if preferred. In case that `pipx` is used for the first time, re-login after the installation may be required in order for `primenote` to be accessible from the command line.

### One-step automated install
* **Installation** `curl -sSL https://install.primenote.cc | bash`
* **Upgrade** `pipx upgrade primenote`
* **Uninstall** `pipx uninstall primenote`

### Manual install
```
# Update system packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Install PrimeNote using the 'pipx' tool
sudo apt-get install pipx
pipx install --include-deps primenote
pipx ensurepath
```

### Vim and Console modes support
- Manually install `QTermWidget` with PyQt bindings enabled. Refer to the [QTermWidget project page](https://github.com/lxqt/qtermwidget) for more details.
- Install `vim-gtk` with client-server mode enabled

# Advanced Features
## Customizable window styles and palettes
- All notes are decorated using CSS files located at the program root;
  - `ui/global.css`: defines the overall geometry and style for all notes
  - `ui/styles/*`: overrides and extend `global.css` attributes
  - `ui/palettes/*`: handles widgets and icons color schemes
- Users can extend those with custom palettes and styles, override or ignore them
- PrimeNote adds its own CSS selector `NoteDecorations` for enhanced customization

## Console mode
- In this mode, the text box is replaced with a native terminal emulator
- When a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) is found, the file content is automatically executed in the terminal
- More QTermWidget color schemes can be added into `ui/terminal`

## Vim mode
- Provides a fully featured Vim instance in every note
- System-independent `vimrc` file and theme files
- Two-way communication between Vim servers and PrimeNote command-line interface
- Default settings allow for a seamless design between the text editing modes

## Virtual machine support
PrimeNote can be used simultaneously across two operating systems (OS). Thus, one can share a note folder with another user, a backup server or a virtual machine.<br/>

PrimeNote fully supports symbolic links (symlinks) on Linux, and partially on Windows. Hence, all notes can be stored in a remote location simply by replacing the notes repository folder with a symlink. Likewise, a symlink can be added into the repository. On Windows, however, please note that shortcuts do not equal symlinks, which require administrator privileges. Thankfully, PrimeNote provide a utility to ease the addition of symlinks into the note repository.

**Virtual machine**
- Create a symlink to the host notes repository
- Place it into a folder shared with the client machine
- On the client side, open a PrimeNote instance and right click on the tray icon
- Select `Open in a file manager`
- Replace the opened folder by the symlink, or add the symlink into it

**Limitations**
- `Rename` and `move` operations on symlinks will behave unexpectedly if used across two OS
- Nested symlinks are not yet supported on Windows
