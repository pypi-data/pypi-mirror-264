At present a number of examples are known to not be functional since
they

  * rely on external libraries which have changed significantly since these
    examples were created
  * rely on services that have changed or disappeared since the examples
    were created.

Or similar.

The leading underscore is a temporary decision to flag that things might not
be working as someone might expect. My plan is to either fix the components
or to remove the components and examples.
