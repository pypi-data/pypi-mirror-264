# jira-notifications

Jira Notifications is a Python package that leverages system D-Bus using the `notify` package to send system toast notifications about new tickets in Jira. It allows users to configure the period for checking new tickets and also sends a daily notification about newly created tickets at a specified time.

## Installation

You can install Jira Notifications via pip:

```
pip install jira-notifications
```
## Usage

After installation, you can use the `jira-notifications` command to generate sample config, update the yaml with correct information

```bash
jira-notifications -g jira.yaml
```
### Linux (Debian Based)
