# the environments file defines the available environments for a deployment

# this can be specified in the deployment to be included as parameter
# e.g.
# required_input:
#   environment:
#     help: "name of the environment"
#     choices: environments
#     required: true

# this can then be used in a template as input
# e.g.
{# jinja2 comment block
  environment_tla: {{ environments[environment].tla }}
#}
