# The Basics

## About Simple Selenium

Simple Selenium is a Python wrapper for Selenium that is intended to make browser automation as painless as possible.

## Main Features

* Automatically installs the correct/latest version of chromedriver/geckodriver for your OS & keeps it updated forever.
* Using Chrome with Simple Selenium is almost completely undetectable by anti-bot services like CloudFlare. Simple Selenium automatically sets the best stealth chrome\_options & patches chromedriver to run undetected while web scraping or running general automation tests.
* Converts Selenium functions into easy-to-remember aliases with plenty of added functionality.
* Incorporates classes like ActionChains & Alert directly into the Simple Selenium WebDriver class for maximum ease of access.
* Adds multiple additional element location methods.
* Built-in startup options for Chrome & FireFox (eg. headless, persistent profiles, etc).
* Proxies are fully supported. Chrome in Simple Selenium supports both IP & username:password authentication, FireFox currently only supports IP authentication.
