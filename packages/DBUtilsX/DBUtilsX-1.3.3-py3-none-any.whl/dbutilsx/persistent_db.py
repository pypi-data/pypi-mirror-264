        creator: either an arbitrary function returning new DB-API 2
            connection objects or a DB-API 2 compliant database module
        maxusage: maximum number of reuses of a single connection
            (number of database operations, 0 or None means unlimited)
            Whenever the limit is reached, the connection will be reset.
        setsession: optional list of SQL commands that may serve to prepare
            the session, e.g. ["set datestyle to ...", "set time zone ..."]
        failures: an optional exception class or a tuple of exception classes
            for which the connection failover mechanism shall be applied,
            if the default (OperationalError, InternalError) is not adequate
        ping: determines when the connection should be checked with ping()
            (0 = None = never, 1 = default = whenever it is requested,
            2 = when a cursor is created, 4 = when a query is executed,
            7 = always, and all other bit combinations of these values)
        closeable: if this is set to true, then closing connections will
            be allowed, but by default this will be silently ignored
        threadlocal: an optional class for representing thread-local data
            that will be used instead of our Python implementation
            (threading.local is faster, but cannot be used in all cases)
