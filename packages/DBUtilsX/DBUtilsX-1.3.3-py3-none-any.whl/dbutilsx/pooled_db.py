        creator: either an arbitrary function returning new DB-API 2
            connection objects or a DB-API 2 compliant database module
        mincached: initial number of idle connections in the pool
            (0 means no connections are made at startup)
        maxcached: maximum number of idle connections in the pool
            (0 or None means unlimited pool size)
        maxshared: maximum number of shared connections
            (0 or None means all connections are dedicated)
            When this maximum number is reached, connections are
            shared if they have been requested as shareable.
        maxconnections: maximum number of connections generally allowed
            (0 or None means an arbitrary number of connections)
        blocking: determines behavior when exceeding the maximum
            (if this is set to true, block and wait until the number of
            connections decreases, otherwise an error will be reported)
        maxusage: maximum number of reuses of a single connection
            (0 or None means unlimited reuse)
            When this maximum usage number of the connection is reached,
            the connection is automatically reset (closed and reopened).
        setsession: optional list of SQL commands that may serve to prepare
            the session, e.g. ["set datestyle to ...", "set time zone ..."]
        reset: how connections should be reset when returned to the pool
            (False or None to rollback transcations started with begin(),
            True to always issue a rollback for safety's sake)
        failures: an optional exception class or a tuple of exception classes
            for which the connection failover mechanism shall be applied,
            if the default (OperationalError, InternalError) is not adequate
        ping: determines when the connection should be checked with ping()
            (0 = None = never, 1 = default = whenever fetched from the pool,
            2 = when a cursor is created, 4 = when a query is executed,
            7 = always, and all other bit combinations of these values)
