Chiasmodon is an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool designed to assist in the process of gathering information about a target domain. Its primary functionality revolves around searching for domain-related data, including domain emails, domain credentials (usernames and passwords), CIDRs (Classless Inter-Domain Routing), ASNs (Autonomous System Numbers), and subdomains. the tool allows users to search by domain, CIDR, ASN, email, username, password, or Google Play application ID. 

## Features

- **Domain Search**: Conduct targeted searches by specifying a domain name to gather relevant information related to the domain.
- **Google Play Application Search**: Search for information related to a specific application on the Google Play Store by providing the application ID.
- **CIDR and ASN Search**: Explore CIDR blocks and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) associated with the target domain to gain insights into network infrastructure and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Email, Username, and Password Search**: Conduct searches based on email, username, or password to identify potential security risks or compromised credentials.
- **Output Customization**: Choose the desired output format (text, JSON, or CSV) and specify the filename to save the search results.
- **Additional Options**: The tool offers various additional options, such as viewing different result types (credentials, URLs, subdomains, emails, passwords, usernames, or applications), setting API tokens, specifying timeouts, limiting results, and more.

## Usage
Chiasmodon provides a flexible and user-friendly command-line interface and python library. Here are some examples to demonstrate its usage:
> How to use pychiasmodon library:
```python3
from pychiasmodon import Chiasmodon as ch 
token = "PUT_HERE_YOUR_API_KEY"
obj = ch(token)
```

- Searching for a target domain:
    - using cli
        ```bash
        chiasmodon_cli.py --domain example.com
        ```
    - using pychiasmodon library
        ```python3
        result = obj.search('example.com',method='domain')
        
        for i in result:
            print(i)
        ```

- Searching for a target domain and its subdomains:
    - using cli
        ```bash
        chiasmodon_cli.py --domain example.com --all
        ```
    - using pychiasmodon library
        ```python3
        result = obj.search('example.com',method='domain', all=True)
        
        for i in result:
            print(i)
        ```

- Searching for a target application ID on the Google Play Store:
    - using cli
        ```bash 
        chiasmodon_cli.py --app com.discord
        ```
    - using pychiasmodon library
        ```python3
        result = obj.search('com.discord',method='app')

        for i in result:
            print(i)
        ```

    - using cli
        ```bash 
        chiasmodon_cli.py --asn AS123 --view-type cred
        ```
    - using pychiasmodon library
        ```python3
        result = obj.search('AS123',method='asn', view_type='cred')

        for i in result:
            print(i)
        ```


- Searching for a target username:
    - using cli
        ```bash 
        chiasmodon_cli.py --username someone

        ```
    - using pychiasmodon library
        ```python3
        result = obj.search('example@123',method='password')

        for i in result:
            print(i)
        ```

- Searching for a target CIDR:

    - using cli
        ```bash 
        chiasmodon_cli.py --cidr x.x.x.x/24
        ```
    - using pychiasmodon library
        ```python3
        result = obj.search('x.x.x.x/24',method='cidr')

        for i in result:
            print(i)
        ```

- Searching for target credentials by domain emails:

    - using cli
        ```bash 
        chiasmodon_cli.py --domain example.com --domain-emails
        ```
    - using pychiasmodon library
