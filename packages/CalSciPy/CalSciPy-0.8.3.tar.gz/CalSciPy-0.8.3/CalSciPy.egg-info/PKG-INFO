CalSciPy is a utility toolbox for calcium imaging experiments. It contains a variety of useful features, from 
interactive visualization of data to computer-generated holography for "read/write" experiments, and 
everything in-between. Essentially, it's a collection of code written for my imaging experiments that might be 
considered useful to others. I was inspired to upload my own code to solve some of the issues outlined in the [motivation](https://calscipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction__motivation.html) section of the [docs](https://calscipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) or at least create a neat package my friends and I could use to easily analyze data across various environments and computers.

#### Active Development
As of version 0.9.8, the current implementation is unstable, partially untested, partially finished, and should be considered an open alpha/beta. ***Please be patient, refactoring my code for public use is a pet-project. I have to graduate at some point and I have a newborn.***

Until things are more stable, I'll explicitly note which subpackages are stable, have >90% test coverage, and are ready-to-use.

#### Stable & Tested Modules
* The main module is ready to use as of 0.7.5. New features will be demarcated by a label indicating the version added in the docs.
#### Experimental
* The organization module is untested but incorporated into the distributed pypi version
* The bruker module is untested but incorporated into the distributed pypi version
* The optogenetics module is untested but incorporated into the distributed pypi version
  
#### Unstable
* The interactive module is unstable but partially incorporated into the distributed pypi version
* The optics module is unstable and not incorporated into the distributed pypi version
  
#### Installation
Eventually I will break things up into sub-packages so you don't have to install everything together...         
`pip install CalSciPy`

#### Roadmap
My current focus is on refactoring tools for holographic optogenetics and circumventing PrairieView's writing of data to proprietary RAW format. I also plan on
breaking up this repo because its many of its contents are too decoupled (e.g., bruker prairieview tricks / helpers vs experiment organization)

#### Contributions
Save me from myself, contributions welcome :)
