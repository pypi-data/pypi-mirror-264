      - "<strong>Predictor genes selection:</strong> when total RNA is extracted from a human sample, the most abundant component is ribosomal RNA (rRNA, 80 to 90%, <em>O'Neil et al. (2013)</em>), which must be removed to measure gene/transcript abundances using RNA-seq technology. Commonly used protocols to remove rRNA are polyadenylated mRNA selection (polyA+) and ribo-depletion (Ribo-Zero). To differentiate these 2 protocols, we selected widely expressed histone genes which produce non-polyadenylated transcripts barely detected into polyA+ RNA-seq. These predictor genes are listed in the legend."
      - "<strong>Specific k-mers quantification:</strong> several specific k-mers designed with Kmerator are associated to each selected histone gene. KmerExploR uses countTags to compute k-mer occurrences number in each RNA-seq sample and calculates the mean count value for each gene (Y axis, mean k-mer counts normalized per billion of k-mers)."
      - "<strong>Threshold :</strong> the threshold was defined based on several RNA-seq datasets but might not fit perfectly your data. Ribo-depleted samples should be above the threshold and polyA+ below."
