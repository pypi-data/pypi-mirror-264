# SPMF
Python Wrapper for [SPMF Java library](http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf).

## Information
This module contains python wrappers for pattern mining algorithms implemented in SPMF Java library. Each algorithm is implemented as a standalone Python class with fully descriptive and tested APIs. It also provides native support for Pandas dataframes.

Why? If you're in a Python pipeline, it might be cumbersome to use Java as an intermediate step. Using `spmf-wrapper` you can stay in your pipeline as though Java is never used at all.

## Installation
[`pip install spmf-wrapper`](https://pypi.org/project/spmf-wrapper/)

A Java Runtime Environment is required to run this wrapper. If an existing installation is not detected, JRE v21 is automatically installed using `install-jdk` python module at `$HOME/.jre/jdk-21.0.2+13-jre`. If you prefer to install Java Runtime manually, follow instructions [`here`](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html). Test installation by running the following command on the terminal:

```
> java -version
java version "1.8.0_391"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_391-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.391-b13, mixed mode)
```

## Usage
Example:
```python
from spmf import EMMA

emma = EMMA(min_support=2, max_window=2, timestamp_present=True, transform=True)
output = emma.run_pandas(input_df)
```

Input:

| | Time points | Itemset
| ---- | ------ | -------
| 0	| 1	| a
| 1	| 2	| a
| 2	| 3	| a
| 3	| 3	| b
| 4	| 6	| a
| 5	| 7	| a
| 6	| 7	| b
| 7	| 8	| c
| 8	| 9	| b
| 9	| 11 | d

Output:

|	| Frequent episode | Support
| --- | ---------------- | -------
|0    |	a     |	5
|1    |	b	|     3
|2    |	a b	|     2
|3	|     a-> a |	3
|4	|     a -> b |	2
|5	|     a -> a b |  2

See [examples]('https://github.com/AakashVasudevan/Py-SPMF/tree/main/examples') for more details.
