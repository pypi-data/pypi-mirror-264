    This wrapped function becomes generally usable in combination with other non-BoTorch

    probabilistic models. The wrapper class returned by this function resolves this
    issue by operating as an adapter that internally creates a helper BoTorch model,

    acquisition function, carrying the posterior information provided from any other
    probabilistic model implementing BayBE's `Surrogate` interface.
