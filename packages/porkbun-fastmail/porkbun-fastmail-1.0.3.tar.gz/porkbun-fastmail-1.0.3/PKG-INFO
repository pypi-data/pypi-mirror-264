# porkbun-fastmail

CLI to quickly add DNS records for [Fastmail](https://fastmail.com) to a [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com) domain.

### Getting Started

1. Generate API tokens using the Porkbun [docs](https://kb.porkbun.com/article/190-getting-started-with-the-porkbun-api).
2. Enable API access on the domain(s) you want to add records to (the "Installing keys and enabling API access on specific domains" in the previous docs link)
3. Clone this git repo locally
4. Install the python dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Create a `.env` file from `.env.template` and populate the secrets
6. Load the `.env` file values into your shell, preferable using [direnv](https://direnv.net/)
7. Run `python -m porkbun-fastmail <yourdomain>`
8. Verify the records were created correctly in the Porkbun admin panel
9. Check the DNS records in the [Fastmail domain settings](https://app.fastmail.com/settings/domains)
10. (Optional) Add a new email address in the [Fastmail email addresses settings](https://app.fastmail.com/settings/addresses)
11. (Optional) Send a test email to and from your new email address
