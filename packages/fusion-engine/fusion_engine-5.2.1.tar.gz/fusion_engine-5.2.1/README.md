Fusion is a game engine for creating graphical applications using OpenGL and the programming language Python. It provides a simple coding interface for creating windows,
rendering graphics, and handling user input. It is and engine to create games fast and easy!

**We also recommend a Go Game Engine called [Vuelto, which is a fast and lightweight Game Engine, made with usabillity in mind. It is a better alternative to Fusion.] (https://github.com/vuelto-org/vuelto)**

## 🗄️ About
This project began May 1, 2023. The original project began in C, but it's entirely rewritten in Python for it's big userbase and ease of use (productivity). This is actually also my EuroPython 2023 project. But after some time, the community has grown, and fusion had a lot of big releases. It was becoming a big project with a giant codebase.
