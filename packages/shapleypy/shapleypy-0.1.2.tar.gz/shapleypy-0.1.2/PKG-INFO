To install latest development version use:

```console
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ shapleypy
```

### Linux

To install this package for Linux you need to set ```$CPPFLAGS``` to contain ```-std=c++11```. This can be achieve by

```bash
export CPPFLAGS="-std=c++11 $CPPFLAGS"
```
> [!NOTE]
> We know that ```CPPFLAGS``` are not meant for C++, but ```CXXFLAGS``` are not suported by setuptools.

or by running the installation in form of

```bash
CPPFLAGS="-std=c++11" pip install shapleypy
```
not to make the standart pernament.

Also there are some non-python dependencies. Those could be installed via distribution package manager.

Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y ppl-dev libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev
```


### MacOS

> [!WARNING]
> Convex game generator is currently not available for MacOS

There are some non-python requirements. These could be installed via homebrew:

```bash
brew install ppl gmp mpfr libmpc
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you installed those dependencies via ```brew``` as shown you probably also will need to set paths of libraries installed by ```brew``` for clang:
> ```export CFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/include/ -L/opt/homebrew/lib/ -I/opt/homebrew/include/ -L/opt/homebrew/lib $CFLAGS"```

> [!WARNING]
> Convex game generator and core solution concept are currently not available for Windows
