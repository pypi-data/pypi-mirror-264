This is a python library developed to automate the machine learning pipeline.
It takes in a dataframe and then do analysis over the same and then return a pickle file which could be used for prediction.
It has 2 modes: Manual and Automatic
- Manual : It involves calling out specific methods for your datafram and the do analysis over the dataset
- Automatic : It automatically does the analysis and give a machine learning model as pickle
