Open-Parse streamlines the process of preparing complex documents for analysis by LLMs. Our goal is to expose state-of-the-art deep learning models with a few lines of code while also providing flexible heuristic options for faster, basic parsing. 

### Highlights

- **üîç Visually-Driven:** Open-Parse visually analyzes documents for superior LLM input, going beyond naive text splitting.
- **‚úçÔ∏è Markdown Support:**  Basic markdown support for parsing headings, bold and italics.
- **üìä High-Precision Table Support:** Extract tables into clean Markdown formats with accuracy that surpasses traditional tools.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Extensible:** Easily implement your own post-processing steps.
- **üí°Intuitive:** Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
- **üéØ Easy:** Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.



## Example

```python
from openparse import DocumentParser

parser = DocumentParser(
    table_args={
        "parse": True,
        "args": {
            "min_table_confidence": 0.75,
            "min_cell_confidence": 0.95,
            "table_output_format": "markdown",
        },
    },
)

parsed = parser.parse("path/to/sample.pdf")

```

## Requirements

Python 3.8+

**Dealing with PDF's:**

- <a href="https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six" class="external-link" target="_blank">pdfminer.six</a> Fully open source.

**Extracting Tables:**

- <a href="https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF" class="external-link" target="_blank">PyMuPDF</a> has some table detection functionality. Please see their <a href="https://mupdf.com/licensing/index.html#commercial" class="external-link" target="_blank">license</a>.
- <a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/table-transformer-detection" class="external-link" target="_blank">Table Transformer</a> is a deep learning approach.
- <a href="https://github.com/poloclub/unitable" class="external-link" target="_blank">unitable</a> is a more recent deep learning approach that seems promising *(coming soon)*

## Installation

#### 1. Core Library


```console
pip install open-parse
```

**Enabling OCR Support**:

PyMuPDF  will already contain all the logic to support OCR functions. But it additionally does need Tesseract‚Äôs language support data, so installation of Tesseract-OCR is still required.

The language support folder location must be communicated either via storing it in the environment variable "TESSDATA_PREFIX", or as a parameter in the applicable functions.

So for a working OCR functionality, make sure to complete this checklist:

1. Install Tesseract.

2. Locate Tesseract‚Äôs language support folder. Typically you will find it here:

   - Windows: `C:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/tessdata`

   - Unix systems: `/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/5/tessdata`

3. Set the environment variable TESSDATA_PREFIX

   - Windows: `setx TESSDATA_PREFIX "C:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/tessdata"`

   - Unix systems: `declare -x TESSDATA_PREFIX= /usr/share/tesseract-ocr/5/tessdata`

**Note:** *On Windows systems, this must happen outside Python ‚Äì before starting your script. Just manipulating os.environ will not work!*

#### 2. ML Table Detection (Optional)

This repository provides an optional feature to parse content from tables using the state-of-the-art Table Transformer (DETR) model. The Table Transformer model, introduced in the paper "PubTables-1M: Towards Comprehensive Table Extraction From Unstructured Documents" by Smock et al., achieves best-in-class results for table extraction.


```console
pip install "open-parse[ml]"
```
