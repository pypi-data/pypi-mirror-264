# eWaterCycle plugin example: a leaky bucket model

This repository is a template for adding models to eWatercycle, and will guide you through all required steps.

As an example this plugin adds the ["leakybucket" model](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/leakybucket-bmi). 

To use the template, press the green "Use this template" button on GitHub, and replace all instances of "leakybucket"/"LeakyBucket" with your model name.

## Installation

Install this package alongside your eWaterCycle installation

```console
pip install ewatercycle-leakybucket
```

Then LeakyBucket becomes available as one of the eWaterCycle models

```python
from ewatercycle.models import LeakyBucket
```

## Implementing your own model

For more information on how this plugin works, and on how to implement your own model see the [plugin guide](plugin_guide.md)
