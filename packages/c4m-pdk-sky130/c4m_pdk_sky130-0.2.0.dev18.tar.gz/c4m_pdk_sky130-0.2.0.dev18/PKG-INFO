# PDKMaster based Sky130 PDK

This is the PDK for Sky130 based on the [PDKMaster](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/PDKMaster) framework. It currently is basically undocumented. Development is driven by sky130 MPW shuttle development.
A little more information on what is possible can be found in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

This development is done in a development branch for new layout generation code of c4m-flexcell.
When this development is done it will be released as version 0.2.0.
