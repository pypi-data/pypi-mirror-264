NEP Python library

==================



NEP+ is a comprehensive software platform designed to assist developers and users in integrating and designing interactive applications that involve a spectrum of agents, whether they are physical (such as robots) or digital (such as digital twins).



The main functionality of NEP+ is to help and support in the design heterogeneous software architectures (i.e., complex applications composed of several modules developed over different programming languages, running on different operating systems, and performing different tasks).
