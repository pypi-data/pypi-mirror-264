"""
	This module offers a streamlined approach to retrieving information on
	audio samples within the Maui project framework. It serves to abstract the
	complexities of accessing and parsing audio file metadata, providing a simple
	method for users to obtain a structured and comprehensive overview of available
	audio samples. The methods returns a pandas DataFrame detailing
	the samples, including aspects such as file paths, durations, and other
	pertinent metadata.

	The functionality leverages the `maui.io` module for the extraction of audio
	information, ensuring consistency and reliability in the data presented.

	Functionality:
	- Simplifies the retrieval of audio sample metadata within the Maui
	  framework.

	Usage:
	- Intended for use in data analysis workflows requiring access to structured
	  information about specific sets of audio samples.

	Dependencies:
	- os: For handling file and directory paths.
	- maui.io: For underlying audio information extraction processes.

	Examples and additional details are provided in the function docstring,
	guiding users in applying the module to their specific needs.
