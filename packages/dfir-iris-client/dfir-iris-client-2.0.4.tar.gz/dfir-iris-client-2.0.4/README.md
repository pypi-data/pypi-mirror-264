# Python client

`dfir_iris_client` offers a Python interface to communicate with IRIS.

It relies exclusively on the API, which means output of the methods are the same as specified in the API reference.

## Versions
The Python client version follows the API versions (until the patch level). Meaning for API v2.0.1, one need to install `dfir_iris_client-2.0.1`. 
Please refer to the [documentation](https://dfir-iris.github.io/operations/api/#references) to check which version applies to your IRIS instance. 

## Install 
IRIS Client is now part of PyPI. You can simply install it with : 
```
pip3 install dfir-iris-client
```

## Build
To build a wheel from the sources:

1. `pip3 install wheel`
2. `python setup.py bdist_wheel`
3. `pip3 install dist/XXX.whl`


## Examples
