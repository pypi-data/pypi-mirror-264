# Pic rucio client

## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Already a pro? Just edit this README.md and make it your own. Want to make it easy? [Use the template at the bottom](#editing-this-readme)!

## Add your files

- [ ] [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://gitlab.pic.es/rucio/rucio-client.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

# PIC-rucio-client
Below is a couple of scripts that facilitate other tests to interact with Rucio's server. In each one of them, the amount and scope corresponding to the person are owed (and in the case that the RSEs are desired, although it is not necessary) First of all, here is a script to do simple uploads of randoms files. Then, Replication of those files in the deterministic RSE. See [pre-commit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jm3LKKI0sTP6Gx0p5PQXRti2NzK_JqG1ITFs761W0KU/edit#heading=h.mkngky6253k8) for instructions.

# gitlab-ci
`gitlab-ci` validates you `.gitlab-ci.yml` file from command-line, before you have commited wrong CI configuration to your repository!

Just as https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/lint.html does, but you don't have to open browser every time.

The better way to use it - use as pre-commit hooks.
