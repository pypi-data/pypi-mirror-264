Are you ready to give Aspose.Cells.GridJs a try? 
Simply execute `pip install aspose_cells_gridjs_net_python`.

General Usage
-------------------------------------------

Below is the basic process steps to develop a web application of `GridJs`.

- Set cache storage directory by  Config.set_file_cache_directory('you storage path')
- Set License by  Config.set_license('you license path')
- Set image route url GridJsWorkbook.set_image_url_base('route for view image');
- Set up a route action to get `json` from the spreadsheet file. You can use `GridJsWorkbook.ImportExcelFile` and `GridJsWorkbook.ExportToJson` APIs, `GridJs` will automatically store the spread file in cache.
- Set up a route action to get `json` for the update operation.You can use `GridJsWorkbook.UpdateCell` `API，GridJs` will do update operation in cache and return the updated `json`.
- Set up a route action to get the images/shapes files url in the spreadsheet, `GridJs` will automatically zip all the images/shapes in cache .It will use `GridCacheForStream.GetFileUrl` API.
- Set up a route action to get file in cache,thus we can get the images/shapes zip file or the spreadsheet file in cache. It will use `GridCacheForStream.LoadStream` API.
- Set up a route action to download the spreadsheet.You can use `GridJsWorkbook.SaveToCacheWithFileName` API.
